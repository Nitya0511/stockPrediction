Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

How we feeling about RKLB,"Pretty significant climb over the last few weeks. 305% YTD. Solid sales at $105 million. A couple rocket launches and it’s looking like we’re getting a Neutron launch in 2025.  

Right now the price is floating around $25/share. Pretty big jump fairly quickly, leaning towards “overbought”. Not sure if we should expect the price to climb any higher in the following weeks or if it’ll balance out around $20/share. But I feel pretty confident in this company and expect solid growth in the years to come.

$Dell Earnings ,"I wanted to get everyone’s take on DELL (down nearly 11% after hours.) I bought 106 shares at 130.5 during their recent run. Didn’t sell today because I like their growth prospects wanted to exit around $150.

The company seems solid, especially with its strength in enterprise solutions and cloud infrastructure, even though consumer PC sales have been an ongoing problem. Despite this Dell has been doubling down on AI, data centers, and hybrid cloud, which I believe should set them up well for growth in 2025. They also stand to benefit from SMCI’s issues and Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs pushing demand for their infrastructure. With the growing focus on AI and enterprise tech, it feels like Dell could see steady, long-term growth and break out to that $150 range by Q2 2024. 

Thoughts? Should I continue to hold? Or sell during the holiday rally? My portfolio time horizon is short giving I plan to liquidate July 2024 to buy a house. ",Negative,Nvidia,939,1
RDDT Q4 prognosis,"Q3 was a big surprise due to DAU skyrocketing and ads $ following. The stock went up huge and has kept most of those gains post-earnings release, notwithstanding the recent 15-20% slump. 

The market quickly revalued the company due to the surprise, but what do we think Q4 will look like?

Any chance of a positive surprise once again? They would have to beat the guidance by a hefty margin for the stock to go up again since it’s rallied so much already.

How much more is Google pushing users to Reddit? I understand the algo changed again recently, was this positive/negative-neutral towards directing more traffic towards Reddit?

Disclosure: Long 12,000 shares are an average cost of $132.

Rivian Receives Conditional Commitment for up to $6.6 Billion Loan from the U.S. Department of Energy,"RVINE, Calif., November 26, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--American all-electric automaker Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) today announced it has received conditional commitment from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing (ATVM) Loan Program for a loan of up to $6.6 billion (including $6 billion of principal and approximately $600 million of capitalized interest) to accelerate its growth and leadership of electric vehicle design, development and manufacturing in the United States.

If finalized, the loan would support the construction of Rivian’s next facility in Stanton Springs North, near the city of Social Circle, Georgia, substantially expanding the company’s domestic production capacity to support demand from the United States and international markets. This loan from DOE would provide significant funding for production of the company’s midsize platform, which underpins the R2, a midsize SUV, and the R3/R3X, a midsize crossover. Designed, engineered, and built in America to deliver an incredible combination of capability, function, performance, and pricing, Rivian believes its R2 and R3 vehicle lines will be critical drivers in the company’s long-term growth and profitability.

The DOE loan would provide an important boost to the U.S. automotive industrial base, enabling significant job creation and investment that is important for the United States to maintain its leadership as electric vehicles become a strategically important industry.

Rivian intends to build the facility in two phases, each resulting in 200,000 units of annual production capacity, for a total of 400,000 units of annual capacity–supporting the sale of American EVs in international markets. Phase 1 of the project is expected to start production in 2028. Rivian is expected to create approximately 7,500 operations jobs through 2030 at the company’s future manufacturing facility in Georgia. This is in addition to 2,000 expected full-time construction jobs that will utilize the region’s significant talent and workforce to further strengthen the domestic EV ecosystem. These jobs complement the thousands Rivian has already created and plans to maintain at its current plant in Normal, Illinois, which have bolstered the local and regional economy.

""This loan will help create thousands of new American jobs and further strengthen U.S. leadership in EV manufacturing and technology,"" said Rivian Founder and CEO RJ Scaringe. ""This loan would enable Rivian to more aggressively scale our U.S. manufacturing footprint for our competitively priced R2 and R3 vehicles that emphasize both capability and affordability. A robust ecosystem of U.S. companies developing and manufacturing EVs is critical for the U.S. to maintain its long-term leadership in transportation.""

Rivian plans to design and build a fully modern manufacturing facility at the Stanton Springs Site, less than one hour’s drive from downtown Atlanta, employing modern construction techniques and advanced environmental management while preserving natural spaces and investing actively in the surrounding communities.

Over the history of the loan program, DOE has helped energize American EV manufacturing with billions in financing for this strategically important industry, including loans to General Motors and Tesla.

While this conditional commitment indicates DOE’s intent to finance the project, DOE and the company must satisfy certain technical, legal, environmental, and financial conditions before the Department of Energy enters into definitive financing documents and funds the loan. If finalized, the loan would be secured by all assets of the project and fixed assets and guarantees of the parent company, Rivian Automotive, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries.

Deep dive into Kering - From Timber to Gucci: A Legacy of Acquisitions,"**1.0 Introduction**

Let’s start with a fun fact. Kering, the company that owns brands like Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent, Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta, and Alexander McQueen, started as a **timber-trading company**.

Although it started back in 1962 and operated in a different industry, its DNA and management style haven’t changed much.

As I’m writing this, its share price is **down over 70%** from its peak back in August 2021 that was elevated due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

  
**2.0 The journey from timber to luxury**

***2.1 The timber period (1962 - 1988)***

The company was founded in France by François Pinault back in 1962 with a 100,000 francs loan from the bank. The business grew rapidly by **acquiring** many failing local timber traders in France, especially in the 1980s. By 1988, it owned 180 companies and 33 factories.

***2.2 The switch from timber to retail to luxury (1988 - 2013 - present)***

In 1988, it was listed on the Paris Stock Exchange and the first transformation from timber to retail started:

* It merged with CFAO (A French distribution conglomerate)
* Acquired Conforama (French furniture retailer)
* Acquired Printemps (Department stores)
* Acquired 54% of La Redoute (French mail-order shopping retailer)
* Acquired Finac (French bookstore, multimedia, and electronics retailer)

The transformation from retail to luxury started in 1999 when it acquired 42% of **Gucci Group,** 100% of **Boucheron,** and 100% of **Yves Saint Laurent.** Today, Gucci accounts for 47% of its revenue.

François-Henri Pinault, the son of the founder François Pinault, became general manager of the company in 2003, and CEO in 2005. Under his leadership, the acquisitions in the luxury space continued.

It is important to note the divestments of their previous acquisitions (Conforama, Le Printemps, CFAO, and Fnac).

Its portfolio is quite diversified and includes:

* High-end clothing
* Footwear
* Handbags and leather goods
* Sunglasses and eyewear
* Scarves & other fashion accessories
* Jewelry
* Fragrances (due to the Creed acquisition)
* Cosmetics (in early stage)
* Watches

It is also geographically diversified:

* **APAC (excl. Japan)**: 32% of revenue
* **Western Europe**: 28% of revenue
* **North America**: 23% of revenue
* **Japan**: 8% of revenue
* **Rest of the World**: 9% of revenue

**3.0 Historical financial performance**

Its revenue increased from €15.9 billion in 2019, to €20.4 billion in 2022, and has contracted back to €18.4 billion as the demand for personal luxury goods started to decrease after the pandemic. 

Kering’s gross margin is stable at \~75%, meaning the direct costs are well controlled.

However, its operating margin is down below 20% (vs. 29% back in 2019). The explanation is simple.

**Reducing operating expenses is an incredibly tough job.**

When there’s less traffic (and subsequently less sales) in the physical stores, the operating expenses remain the same. The company still needs to pay the lease payment, its employees, the utility bills, etc. In fact, these expenses grow over time as there’s the impact of inflation.

Scaling down, by closing locations is also not a free option. Not only does it bring penalties for ending a lease contract earlier, but it also leads to losing all the revenue and profitability from that location.

The company is generating substantial cash flows, but I’ll argue the capital allocation is poor.

||all numbers in €m|
|:-|:-|
|Cash (January 2019)|€1.837|
|Operating cash flow|€21.541|
|Capex|(€7.772)|
|Acquisitions|(€6.559)|
|Debt|€4.887|
|Share buyback|(€2.034)|
|Dividends|(€8.229)|
|Other|€25|
|Cash (June 2024)|€3.696|

Between 2019 and H1-2024, the company generated **over €21.5 billion** in operating cash flow, or **a bit less than €14 billion after capex.**

Close to 60% of it was returned back to the shareholders via dividends, and an additional 15% through share buybacks. What’s left of the free cash flow, together with additional debt, was used for acquisitions.

Why do I think the capital allocation is poor? Two main reasons:

1. Almost 80% of the share buybacks were used in 2021 and 2022, the years when the share price was the highest (and temporarily elevated). A good capital allocator can recognize when the price is too high to buy back shares.
2. Its net debt position more than doubled, from **€7.1 billion** in 2019 to **€15.4 billion** as of June 30th, 2024. This is equal to \~60% of its market cap. The interest rate on their debt ranges from 0.75% to 5% and if the refinancing is done at a higher rate, it could significantly reduce its profit margins.



**4.0 What can be expected?**

Based on the latest investor presentation, there are three capital allocation priorities:

* Organic growth;
* Shareholder return; and
* Fuel high-potential adjacent businesses.

All of it, while having a **healthy financial situation and FCF generation.**

This is a good attempt by the management to summarize what to expect from the company. I find this slide a bit odd for three reasons:

1. On one side they want to return capital to the shareholders, which would position them as a company **with a goal to preserve capital and provide reliable dividends**. On the other side, its history is full of **acquisitions, which is the opposite of preserving capital.**
2. The center of the slide points to a healthy financial situation and FCF generation, while its net debt more than doubled in the last 5 years (**€7.1 billion** in 2019 to **€15.4 billion** as of June 30th, 2024).
3. Innovation is not a focus at all. Roughly 2 months ago, EssilorLuxottica and Meta announced a partnership in the smart eyewear category. I see a lot of potential in this area that isn’t utilized (yet).

**Growing through acquisitions and distributing dividends seems to be the DNA of the company and likely what one should expect going forward.**

  
**5.0 Dividends**

The dividend per share has been steadily increasing from €4 back in 2015, to €14 in 2024. The current dividend yield is \~6%.

If the management focuses on reducing the debt and dividends (instead of borrowing to acquire more companies), Kering could become an incredibly appealing dividend investment option.

  
**6.0 High employee turnover**

At the end of 2023, the company had 48,964 employees. During the year, there were **13,403** new hires, and **11,275** employees departed. At first glance, this is no doubt a high turnover.

This sounds bad at first, but it is really difficult to decipher.

In theory, any company that has seasonal employment patterns will hire more employees (temporarily) during peak seasons. Therefore the increase, and subsequently decrease, of employees is normal. This is even more so in industries where the work is repetitive (such as sales and manufacturing).

In addition, 59% of the employees are Gen Y (1981-1995), a generation that is known for seeking career growth, which could lead to more job-hopping than average.

Given the reviews on Indeed, Glassdoor, and Comparably, there is no indication that this is currently a serious issue.

  
**7.0 The concerns**

**7.1 Balenciaga Advertising Scandal (2022)**

Back in 2022, Balenciaga faced significant backlash over their advertising campaign. One of them featured children holding teddy bears dressed in bondage-inspired outfits. This was rightfully criticized and labeled as inappropriate.

This brings into question the ethics behind those who are in charge of product development and marketing.

In addition, given how concentrated their portfolio is in the top 3 brands (Gucci - 46%, YSL - 17%, Bottega Veneta - 9%), scandals of this kind could have a significant impact.

**7.2 Preliminary investigation by the European Commission (2023)**

In April 2023, the European Commission initiated a preliminary investigation into potential antitrust violations within the fashion sector. One of the inspections took place at the Italian premises of Gucci.

An investigation of this kind does not imply guilt, but if a company is found in breach of EU antitrust rules, there could lead to a fine of a few billion euros.

The investigation is still ongoing, and no conclusions have been reached.

  
**8.0 Valuation** 

This is a mature market that will be around for a very long time. Therefore, here are my assumptions when it comes to valuing Kering:

* **Revenue** \- The industry is cyclical in nature, so there will be good and bad times. Based on the past, I do not feel confident that Kering can take market share, so I expect its growth to normalize at \~3% per year, which is in line with the inflation rate.
* **Operating margin** \- The luxury market is getting more crowded, and as argued earlier, reducing operating expenses is not an easy task. Once the demand is somewhat stable, I expect the operating margin to increase to 21%.

Based on those assumptions (and a discount rate of \~9%), the fair value of the company is **€27 billion (€220/share)** which is very close to the current price of **€224/share**.

This offers an IRR of \~9%, which is slightly below the historical return of the S&P500.

  
**8.1 The Bull Case**

Those who are betting on Kering, are ultimately betting that there will be revenue growth and margin expansion through some of the following:

* Revitalization of Balenciaga & rebuilding its reputation after the controversies;
* Sustained growth in Gucci, and expansion of secondary brands like Bottega Veneta & Saint Laurent;
* The success of its newly launched beauty division, capturing market share from rivals like LVMH and Estee Lauder;
* Positive macro tailwinds;

* Utilizing pricing power;
* Integration of recent acquisitions;
* Reducing operating costs;

**If the management can pull this off, then the value per share could be 2x from today’s share price.**



**8.2 The Bear Case**

Those who are betting against Kering, are ultimately betting that there will be revenue decline and margin compression through some of the following:

* Brand mismanagement & more scandals;
* Inability to revitalize Balenciaga;
* Inability to innovate around its primary brands;
* Failure to integrate its acquisitions & further poor M&A acquisitions;
* Negative macro tailwinds;
* Inability to innovate around E-Commerce;
* Supply chain issues;
* Competitive pressure;
* Increase in corporate tax by the French authorities

**In this scenario, the fair value per share could be below €100/share.**

These are the stocks on my watchlist (11/26),"# I'm back.

I use IBKR TWS for my platform and charts.

I am targeting potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. This means the potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, not the business, long-term prospects, or the people involved.

PLEASE ask specific questions and PLEASE don’t ask about earnings because I typically don’t take positions before earnings announcements. Questions like “Thoughts on \_\_\_\_\_?” or “Why isn’t \_\_\_ on the watchlist?” or something answered already will be ignored unless you add detail and your opinion.  If you post a question and delete it after I answer it, I will block you- doing that hurts discussion. I am not answering questions if I’m still long or short a stock beyond what I update.

"California plan excludes Tesla from new EV tax credits, governor's office says","Tesla's electric vehicles likely would not qualify for California's new state tax credits under a proposal in the works if President-elect Donald Trump scraps the federal tax credit for EV purchases, Governor Gavin Newsom's office said on Monday.
Tesla shares closed down 4%.

Trump's transition team is considering eliminating the federal tax credit of $7,500 for EV purchases, Reuters reported this month.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a close Trump adviser, sharply criticized the idea of barring the automaker from EV subsidies writing on X in response ""Even though Tesla is the only company who manufactures their EVs in California! This is insane.""

Musk has said he supports ending subsidies for EVs, oil and gas.

Newsom said on Monday that if Trump eliminates a federal EV tax credit, he will propose creating a new version of the state’s Clean Vehicle Rebate Program that ended in 2023 and spent $1.49 billion to subsidize more than 594,000 vehicles.

""The governor’s proposal for ZEV rebates, and any potential market cap, is subject to negotiation with the legislature. Any potential market cap would be intended to foster market competition, innovation and to support new market entrants,"" the office said.

California provided up to $7,500 for the purchase or lease of a new plug-in hybrid, battery or fuel cell EV and could potentially be paid for by the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund which is funded by polluters under the state's cap-and-trade program.

Musk and Newsom have clashed over state policies such as shutting Tesla's Fremont factory during the pandemic and California's approval of a bill on transgender kids.

In 2021, Tesla moved its headquarters from California to Texas, and Musk said this year that his other companies such as SpaceX and social media platform X will follow suit.

California has crossed the 2 million mark for sales of zero-emission vehicles, doubling total sales since 2022.

Last month, a California official said he expects the Environmental Protection Agency to approve the state's plan to halt the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035, a proposal that major automakers have met with skepticism.
California's rules, which have been adopted by a dozen other states, require 80% of all new vehicles sold in the state be electric by 2035 and no more than 20% plug-in hybrid electric.

That said, I’m always looking to improve, and I’m wondering if integrating technical analysis into my approach could help me refine my strategy further. I usually hold my positions for a few days to a few weeks. I have a few questions:
	
1.	Which technical indicators would you recommend for someone trading on a short to medium term basis and reacting to news-driven moves?
	
2.	Are there specific timeframes or chart setups that work better for trades lasting days or weeks? 
	
3.	Are there any books, courses, or resources you’d recommend for learning technical analysis, especially for high-volatility setups?
	
4.	How do you handle risk management when trading in such volatile environments?

5.   How can I identify which stocks are likely to have the highest trading volume or volatility during the day ?

I know there’s no one size fits all solution, but I believe combining fundamental insights with technical analysis could help me make better informed decisions.


Thanks in advance to anyone who shares their experience or advice!

Opinions on ZETA?,"
I have watched this stock for some time and it is super interesting.

• Culper research shorts ZETA and publishes findings on some misconducts from ZETA.

• Shares drop big time

• ZETA responds to all claims from culper and
""proves"" them as lies. One of examples is that Culper mentiones EY as ZETA's auditor but EY was never ZETA's auditor. It was always Deloitte...

• ZETA insiders buy large amount of shares as another sign to support the company and that Culper research is lying and playing dirty.

• Shares bounce back a bit.

• Former Louisiana attorney general leads class action suit against ZETA (another dirty move to stop a bounce back or honestly concerned ex politician?).

• Shares drop this week again.

Isn't it crazy how few people can destroy a company for personal interest using deception and dirty tricks? Or is the company the one that is corrupt?

In my opinion Culper clearly lied on many things as a strategy for their short positions, history showed that companies that were shorted by Culper did just fine in the future. Is this case the same?

What is your opinion on this? Is it good entry point, is it too risky to enter.

Btw fundamentals of this company are good.
Healthy growth, nice debt ratio and management, strong institutional ownership etc.

Does ENPH still has a moat?,"Anyone who follows ENPH closely, or the solar industry in general, does ENPH still have a moat with their microinverters? 

Solar industry recently took a huge downturn with president elect, new competition, California, etc. But I'm still (bag)holding ENPH believing it will come back as long as it continues with its leading technology. While doing research, I remember most & if not all articles that wrote about ENPH mentioned microinverters as their moat; however, it's difficult to find anyone mentioning about it lately. I'm sure part of the earlier mentions had to do with hype, but am curious if they are losing their technical advantage over peers recently.

Recently I’ve been getting more and more interested in investing, instead of letting my money sit in savings. I have around $500,- available to invest. At first I just wanted to put it all in Vanguard S&P 500, but is this a good idea? And if not, what do you suggest?

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Why MicroStrategy Stock Rocketed 24.7% Higher This Week,"MicroStrategy has been the talk of YouTube lately with most posters being very bullish.  This article presents a slightly bearish case.

* Convertible Debt: MicroStrategy issued a $3 billion convertible note with a 0% interest rate, due in 2029, allowing them to buy more Bitcoin1.

Speculate on GOOG - what'd be the best countermove against DoJ slaps? ,"For those who were sleeping/partying on the weekend, the following happened:

* DoJ said, Google should divest off Chrome and may not reenter the browser market for five years
* prohibited from ""acquiring any interests in search rivals, potential entrants, and rival search or search ads-related AI products""
* halt all ""anticompetitive payments to distributors, including Apple, Samsung"" so that Google isn't the default search engine on their devices
* content creators can choose to opt-out of Google crawlers to train its AI

Most obvious historical comparison is case against Microsoft Corp. in 2001; the DoJ tried to split Microsoft up due to its hold over the web browser market on Windows, though this case **ultimately resulted in a settlement**. With that in mind, it is possible, the DoJ will go this way, this time.

* Search is close to 50% revenue of Google \[Q3 results\]
* Browsers market shares: Chrome 60%, Safari 18%, Edge 8% \[Source can be contested, because it's larger devices stats only\]
* Android - 70% market share in handheld devices

GOOG has to fight hard to ensure a high search traffic. It may have a few options up its sleeves.

|:-|:-|:-|
|""Chrome"" as a stand-alone listed company like Opera browser.|Possibly the worst move. Average user unlikely to install a browser-only app, than stick with factory default browser on the device. ||
|Chrome+Gemini as a new company, to command an ""AI"" valuation.|Not likely to attract advertisers, until this new 'app' gets wild Chat-GPT like popularity. ||
|Android+Chrome as a new company, provides operating system for device manufacturers|Won't make sense, because Samsung already has their prop. version of Android. And to gain search traffic, Google again needs to partner with this new company, which is prohibited.||
|A company with ""personal suite"" of applications, Gmail, Calendar, Docs and Chrome bundled together|Chrome then gets 100's million users from Day-1. Still, above legal prohibition remains. ||

MDA Space blowing up by year’s end (contract incoming),"All this hype with RKLB, LUNR, and RDW and no-one is mentioning MDA (mktcap - 3.2b CAD). Yeah I know it mainly trades on Toronto but just get a broker that supports Toronto, eg IBKR. They’re planning to list on US soon but by then it will probably already have taken off...

Their earnings report was stellar: growth of 38% yoy, it is actually **PROFITABLE** \- none of the other space companies are profitable - profitability with adjusted EBITDA of $55.5 million, up 30% YoY, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.7%, net income up 60% yoy, and net debt adjusted EBITDA ratio of just 0.8x (so zero risk of dilution). However, post earnings the stock was mostly flat. Why? Their reported backlog was unchanged from previous quarter report (backlog is 4.6B btw).

But if any of you folks had bothered to tune in to the call, you would have heard the CEO say that it is a fact that by year end they will be **definitely be signing a new contract worth 750M** – of these, only 300M is recorded in backlog – a**n additional $450M is going to be added** upon finalization and t**his will happen by year’s end.** They in fact stated during the Q&A that they are confident they will be finishing 2024 with $5B backlog. They also said MDA’s satellite systems division alone has a $**15B+ pipeline** of potential projects, thanks to its Aurora-class satellites tailored for low Earth orbit (LEO) constellations.

Still not convinced? Consider:

\> MDA is building a new 185,000 sq. ft. facility in Quebec, **capable of producing two satellites per day** starting in late 2025.

\>Planet labs is currently generating about 200million in revenue per year. MDA’s geointelligence segment is also generating about 200million in revenue per year. However, MDA’s geo segment represents **only about 20%** of MDA’s total revenue. PL’s marketcap is currently almost **1B**. MDA is 3.1 CAD = **2.2B USD**. Oh, and PL is currently operating at a loss (though that might change next report) but MDA is running a profit. Based on this fact alone, MDA’s mkt cap should be at least double than what it is.

Ganja Bear Case (and one possible exception),"I think cannabis is an abysmally bad investment opportunity (with one exception) and almost no one knows why, because the precise nature of how THC as a drug operates isn't well understood by people who aren't both habitual consumers \*and\* up-to-date with knowledge on that sector this past decade or so.

It's the following issue: Let's say it's 2010 when cannabis is still illegal everywhere and I want to get high, I light up a single (1) joint with my friend, we smoke for 20 minutes, and then we're giggling. We go to buy some twice a month or so. A few years later it's been legalized and a ton of money floods into the space. Growers are all trying to compete with each other to take advantage of the laws changing, everyone wants to make stronger weed that gets you high more quickly than the other kinds, to draw customers to them, get market share and so on. ""Buy my iridescent purple galactic stardust reefer that gets you as high in one puff as 10x that amount of the neighboring place's stuff.""

This is a race to the bottom. Soon everyone is selling incredibly strong stuff, but you need \*far less\* of it to get the same high. Habitual users spend less than 10% of what they used to on weed now, everything is absurdly strong and cheap because of this competition. In addition you now have hash oil, edibles, dab pens, tinctures, you name it. Not just regular flower.

I never smoked much anyway, but in the rare case I want a mini-vacation now, I can take a vial of Tincture and put \*one drop\* under my tongue. Within two hours the world is spinning. It's so strong I never use it as anything other than a sleeping aid about once a month. A single bottle of this costs about $65, and it comfortably lasts me an entire year. This is a disaster for the industry because I almost never need to give them business. It's so strong that I rarely need to make a purchase at all. And no need for all the paraphernalia with it either. No vapes, pipes, lighters etc. The bottle comes with an eyedropper. Even if I use it often and develop a high tolerance, I still rarely need to go out for more. My friend and I have no reason to go smoke or spend much money on the supplies for it when for 1/100th the price we can get the same high now, assuming one of us has a tincture (or dab vape pen, or edible, or a newly exotic and potent strain) at home.

Compare this with alcohol, where you can't make, say, vodka much stronger than it is. It's impossible for me to come up with a 10x stronger vodka to put my competitors out of business because it's physically impossible for alcohol to exist at room temperature at concentrations higher than \~97% (I think), and vodka is already around 45% and can't reasonably go much higher (taste etc). Also there is a social nature to it that weed lacks, beer works more as a refreshment beverage like coke etc.

Or cigarettes, where even if you have a huge nicotine tolerance from constant Zyn use, the nature of the substance requires you to take it every couple hours to keep from getting jittery. You can't just get a year's supply of nicotine in a bottle because (first of all it'd be fatal with a slight dosage error) you need to have it in measured amounts you can take every 2-4 hours regardless of how much you're used to consuming, assuming you're dependent on it to begin with of course. And so it is a consistent business for sellers. This is most true of cigarettes, but also applies to vapes and pouches, which have similarly excellent profit margins. All of these a nicotine addict must consume regularly. Regulations also limit how much nicotine you can put in each product.

It is a subscription model, in short, while weed is equivalent to motor oil in terms of how often someone (a very heavy user to boot) has to go out and buy some, and how much they spend. Alcohol has some issues as well of lesser magnitude that I can go into elsewhere, but can lean on its usefulness in social situations whereas weed cannot.

The only exception to this? Turning Point Brands (TPB) stock, because they don't sell weed. They sell rolling papers and other paraphernalia for it. Which is indeed still a growing business if it gets legalized in more places and benefits from the greater proliferation of the stuff. Actual weed sellers do not, because the increased proliferation is offset by people needing to buy less of it for the same results due to increased THC concentration in the products. You can't sell 1/10th as much paper to people for the same effect, or at least it's less affected by this issue. The company also is wisely getting into nicotine pouches although this is very ambitious of them to compete with the tobacco majors directly on something. Not sure how that'll work out. Keep in mind this is a small cap company, less than $1 billion in market cap, reflecting how little profit there is to be made even on the periphery of this sector. But it's one small and thriving business I can find that has benefited from all this quite nicely. Not sure how much more it can grow, it's probably overvalued now, but in the past year or so it's risen strongly.

Otherwise? Cronos and other weed stocks? Bunk. For the birds. There might be an exception for medical marijuana (CBD) companies but that's pure conjecture as far as I know. You can make condensed CBD products just the same.",Positive,,5350,0
Evaluation of Companies with Down Revenue,"I find this an interesting topic and am interested how others feel if a company would be considered potentially bullish with the following fundamentals.

- Cash flow per share growth (year over year)
- *Net profit margin growth (year over year)
- Lower long-term debt (year over year)

BUT ALSO HAS…

- Lower revenue (year over year)
- Lower net income (year over year)
- Lower earnings per share (year over year)

In my opinion when revenue (or net income) is declining, and not flat or increasing, it is a concern that the company could be on the brink of a big downturn. Especially in a continued pattern of these results.

However, I often see companies with these symptoms, (sometimes in different combinations but at least two of these are lower year over year), however the chart is very bullish at times…

Delaware Funds by Macquarie,"Does anyone have any insight into Delaware Funds managed by Macquarie? 

Unfortunately, I was persuaded to purchase into one of the small / mid cap mutual funds in December 2020. Obviously the market was on a bit of a run there, but everything about the fund (historical build up, Morningstar ratings, length of existence of the fund, recommendations by publications, YoY performance,  etc) led me to believe it was a reasonable, if somewhat more aggressive, investment.  

It was all well and good for about a year, as the market rebounded from Covid and this particular fund hummed along with the rest of the economy.   Articles like [this in the mainstream press](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/4-stock-picks-for-the-post-pandemic-nesting-economy-from-a-five-star-money-manager-11636995166?mod=bnbh_mwarticle) lent further credence that the fund was solid and the fund managers respected by financial journalism. 

And then it did a capital gains distribution (historically very normal for this fund) in December 2021 and then the share price immediately started its plummet.  Like, overnight, lost $15/share.  Similarly, it went seemingly overnight from a Morningstar 5 rating to a 2 rating.  It continued to fall from there. 

  
I guess I am one of those silly buy and hold people.  I always assume that short term losses will eventually be made up in the long term.  Since then....no. 

  
Earlier this year, Delaware merged a couple of their funds, so DFDIX became IYMIX.   As far as I can tell, the holdings in IYMIX are not radically different than what DFDIX held.   In a market that has been turbo charged for the past year, the growths of this fund have been glacial.   I realize that the holdings are small / mid cap and those are ostensibly still being knocked around by high interest rates, but the three years since that initial freefall following the capital gains distribution has not really begun to make up the ground that the fund dramatically lost. 

I've literally never been in a mutual fund that actively lost money for me.  Plenty have not grown in dramatic ways, but actually halving of value?  That's never happened before. 

Does anyone have any insight into this investment company or explanation why a small / midcap fund would depreciate to such a dramatic extent and fail to recover over a period of years when stock market growth is explosive?

What I learnt from MSTR frenzy,"I have been a long term investor in MSTR, in fact buying  my position Pre-split.  
My thesis was very much connected to an alternative investment vehicle into Bitcoin.  Even though I have BTC as a holding in my crypto, I was more after exposure in an equity portfolio.

To cut a long story short, I bought it when it was no mainstream and no ETF's were existing.

I must admit, I sat on a loss for about one year in MSTR.  Buying at $48.10 (split adjusted), and for the longest time sitting at the $25-$30 range, BTC was consolidating and I was fine with that.

If people understand what MSTR are doing, this playbook with bonds and hedging BTC was already in play for a long time, I was lucky enough to understand this quite early and and bought it quite early.  The difference being now that BTC is on a breakout and other companies are now looking into this method as well, the eyes on MSTR has multiplied exponentially .

Fast forward one year, and and the FOMO crowd arrived, and with that volatility.

Here is what I learnt when the FOMO arrived:

1. The stock is no longer trading on anything but emotion and speculation.
2. Valuations do not matter anymore.  The premium on BTC was as low as 1.5 less than one year go, reaching a peak earlier this week at 3.5
3. The stock goes up like crazy, and comes down like crazy, and when this happens, it's time to exit as there is nothing that is in your control.
4. There is so much manipulation (e.g. the citron report, Social media, Mainstream coverage), on what... a damn tweet!  it is not really easy to understand how this will move, so at this point it is just gambling.

I held my position up to the $543 level, and eventually my stop losses triggered yesterday around the $500 level.  So after 1.5 years, I am out of the MSTR trade.

The lesson I learnt is when the crowds arrive, turn round and walk away.

I still believe in the MSTR playbook, but will only come back when I am at the front of the queue buying at a negotiated price not when I am in a bidding war with gamblers.",Negative,,2039,0
Thoughts and dilemma on Rocket Lab? ,"I went into Rocket Lab back in July with the intention of making it my primary long-term growth stock and since then have managed to acquire 440 shares at average price of around $9.  

My intention was/is to keep buying and hold the stock for many many years, because I truly believe in the company potential and the overall space industry and I believe that it will be a key growth sector for the next decade and beyond regardless of who is in power in the US. (I am not american btw)

Just before the election I was in profit in the low thousands, which was nice but since the election I am now sitting at a profit of 147%, which is my best position in my investing ""career"" so far. 

Like I said, I believe the company will do well regardless of who is in power. However, given the fast rise since the election I am expecting correction happening soon. 

And my dilemma is: should exit now and take the profits and then go back in after the correction? Or should I just hold until the potential correction and start buying more then?

Are we putting too much faith in generative AI? Could this hurt AI investments more broadly?,"Obviously a lot of money is being made off of AI-related stocks. I'm not one of those lucky investors. Part of the reason is that I fear we're not in a general AI bubble, as many have discussed, but rather a *generative AI* bubble. I'd appreciate hearing how others feel about this.

Right now, by far the bulk of investment is focused on generative AI (especially LLMs), with NVDA at or very near the center of it all, thanks to its GPUs. Meanwhile, alternative AI approaches (e.g., neuromorphic computing, symbolic AI, reinforcement learning, and hybrid models) have been getting far less attention.

The problem? As impressive as it may seem, generative AI has some significant (and inherent) drawbacks:

* Factually unreliable outputs (it can’t reliably distinguish fact from fiction)
* Probabilistic reasoning (no true causal understanding)
* High computational costs (questionable sustainability)
* Limited real-world problem-solving abilities

At some point, the reality of generative AI's limitations will become apparent enough to investors that we could see an AI market correction or even collapse. This would not only hurt AI stocks like NVDA, but it could also starve funding for alternative AI approaches that have long-term potential yet have been largely overlooked.

C3AI begins to turn the tide,"C3.ai shares jumped 25% in a single day on the announcement of a deeper partnership with Microsoft. The new agreement clarifies Microsoft Azure as C3.ai's preferred cloud services platform and C3.ai's AI applications as Azure's preferred enterprise solutions. Although the two have been working together since 2018, this announcement pushes the market's focus on its AI potential higher.

Underestimated potential: c3.ai's revenue grew 21% in the quarter and is expected to grow 24% going forward. Current market capitalization is \~$4 billion and trades at a multiple of 11x its FY2025 revenue target.

Pilots: The company has 224 pilots, 85% of which are active, representing a 117% year-over-year increase in the number of pilots. 70% of pilots are expected to be converted into formal contracts.

Future Potential: Revenues are expected to pick up to 30% from current growth rates through pilots to formal deals. 2026 FY projected revenue target is $462 million, with a share price potential of up to $36 if it reaches an 8x EV/revenue valuation.

While the partnership has boosted market enthusiasm, I would wait for market sentiment to pull back before getting in. In addition, the conversion of pilots to full-fledged programs is key to future growth.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Intuit shares drop as quarterly forecast misses estimates due to delayed revenue,"Intuit shares fell 6% in extended trading Thursday after the finance software maker issued a revenue forecast for the current quarter that trailed analysts’ estimates due to some sales being delayed.

Here’s how the company performed in comparison with LSEG consensus:

Earnings per share: $2.50 adjusted vs. $2.35 expected

Revenue: $3.28 billion vs. $3.14 billion

Revenue increased 10% year over year in the quarter, which ended Oct. 31, according to a statement. Net income fell to $197 million, or 70 cents per share, from $241 million, or 85 cents per share, a year ago.

While results for the fiscal first quarter topped estimates, second-quarter guidance was light. Intuit said it anticipates a single-digit decline in revenue from the consumer segment because of promotional changes for the TurboTax desktop software in retail environments. While that will affect revenue timing, it won’t have any impact on the full 2025 fiscal year.

Intuit called for second-quarter earnings of $2.55 to $2.61 per share, with $3.81 billion to $3.85 billion in revenue. The consensus from LSEG was $3.20 per share and $3.87 billion in revenue.

For the full year, Intuit expects $19.16 to $19.36 in adjusted earnings per share on $18.16 billion to $18.35 billion in revenue. That implies revenue growth of between 12% and 13%. Analysts polled by LSEG were looking for $19.33 in adjusted earnings per share and $18.26 billion in revenue.

Revenue from Intuit’s global business solutions group came in at $2.5 billion in the first quarter. The figure was up 9% and in line with estimates, according to StreetAccount. Formerly known as the small business and self-employed segment, the group includes Mailchimp, QuickBooks, small business financing and merchant payment processing.

“We are seeing good progress serving mid-market customers in MailChimp, but are seeing higher churn from smaller customers,” Sandeep Aujla, Intuit’s finance chief, said on a conference call with analysts. “We are addressing this by making product enhancements and driving feature discoverability and adoption to improve first-time use and customer retention.”

Better outcomes are a few quarters away, Aujla said.

CreditKarma revenue came in at $524 million, above StreetAccount’s $430 million consensus.

At Thursday’s close, Intuit shares were up about 9% so far in 2024, while the S&P 500 has gained almost 25% in the same period.

On Tuesday Intuit shares slipped 5% after The Washington Post said President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed “Department of Government Efficiency” had discussed developing a mobile app for federal income tax filing. But a mobile app for submitting returns from Intuit is “already available to all Americans,” CEO Sasan Goodarzi told CNBC’s Jon Fortt.

Goodarzi said on CNBC that he’s personally communicating with leaders of the incoming presidential administration.

On the earnings call, Goodarzi sounded optimistic about the economy.

“Our belief, which is not baked into our guidance, is that we will see an improved environment as we look ahead in 2025, particularly just with some of the things that I mentioned earlier around just interest rates, jobs, the regulatory environment,” he said. “These things have a real burden on businesses. And we believe that a better future is to come.”

Deep dive into Etsy - On a path to a dangerous spiral,"**1.0 Introduction**

Etsy started by brilliantly carving out a niche in handmade and vintage goods, but now it faces challenges that threaten its unique spot in e-commerce and I’ll argue it is going down the path to a dangerous spiral.

The idea to connect buyers with sellers of handmade/vintage goods is amazing, and there’s no doubt that there is demand for it.

Any marketplace has two important metrics:

* The **Gross Merchandise Value**, also known as “GMV”, represents the value of all products sold through the website. Etsy decided to use **Gross Merchandise Sales** (“GMS“), which is just a different term.
* The **take-rate** represents their share of the GMS.

Its GMS increased from \~$4 billion in 2018 (prior to the pandemic) to $13.5 billion in 2021. However, since then, Etsy has experienced a decline and the GMS in 2023 was $13.2 billion. The lack of growth is either a lack of demand or a lack of supply in the marketplace.

**2.0 The real problem**

The company discloses the number of active buyers and sellers, and together, they paint quite a picture.

The number of active sellers continued to grow. From 2021 to 2023, it increased from 7.5 million to 9 million.

The number of buyers has been flat.

Economics101 teaches us a simple lesson: ***If the demand is stable, and there is an increase in supply, the prices will decrease.***

Economics also teaches that ***lower prices would attract more buyers, increasing the demand.***

***So, where are the buyers?***

As Etsy doesn’t (and cannot) check the quality of all the products, more and more AI-generated product images combined with dropshipping flood the market. Here's a comment from a Reddit user that in my opinion does a great job summarizing the development:

""*Drop-shipping has absolutely ruined online marketplaces. I used to adore Etsy when it first started, but now its just absolute garbage. You have to reverse image search everything nowadays to make sure it's the real deal and actually handmade. This recently happened to me when I was trying to buy some pretty dice for my dnd group. Turned out it was a scam using a real artisan's pictures to sell their cheap shit. Thankfully, I was able to rectify the issue, but it was a hustle.*""

The U.S. sellers used to contribute over 75% of Etsy’s revenue a decade ago. Now, it’s down to \~50%.

I’ll argue that this might lead to a spiral that will harm Etsy in the long run, with the events being:

1. Increase in low-value products on Etsy.
2. The low-value products will be perceived as a better deal when compared to the high-value products as they are cheaper.
3. The sellers of high-value products will sell fewer products, and some of them will eventually leave Etsy.
4. The buyers will be disappointed by the low-value products and will not use Etsy as much (or at all).

**3.0 What is Etsy doing?**

Etsy is spending \~30% of its revenue on Marketing (vs. 20% a decade ago) and has even engaged in TV ads to raise awareness and bring new customers.

Over the last few years, the company has been spending $700-800m per year, only to keep the revenue flat. It is accepting the fact that buyers will be disappointed, and the strategy is to replace them with new ones.

**4.0 The take-rate**

The only other way for Etsy to grow its revenue is to increase its take-rate, and its share of the GMS.

The company splits its revenue into two groups:

* **Marketplace revenue** (\~73% of total) - These are **required** fees that cannot be avoided (Transaction fees, payment processing fees, listing fees).
* **Service revenue** (\~27% of total) - These are **optional**, such as on-site advertising, shipping labels, etc.

Its take-rate is incredibly high at \~21%, double from a decade ago. For comparison, eBay’s take rate is \~14%.

**5.0 Terrible management decisions**

As the company was reaching its peak, the management decided to make 3 large acquisitions:

* **Reverb** (Aug 15th, 2019) - A marketplace for new, used, and vintage music gear was acquired for **$270 million**.
* **Elo 7** (July 2nd, 2021) - Also known as the “Etsy of Brazil”, a Brazil-based marketplace for unique, handmade items was acquired for **$212 million**.
* **Depop** (July 12th, 2021) - a global fashion resale marketplace was acquired for \~**$1.5 billion**.

It is important to note that Depop had an annual revenue of **$70 million!** No, this is not a typo. Etsy paid over 20x its revenue to acquire Depop!

Well, not that long later, in Q3-2022, the company recorded impairment charges of **over $1 billion** for Depop and Elo7. No better way to destroy shareholders’ value quickly, than by overpaying for an acquisition.

A year later, in Q3-2023, Elo7 was sold at a loss.

**6.0 Historical financial performance**

Historically, this is still an impressive growth. Its revenue grew from <$200 million a decade ago, to $2.8 billion in the last twelve months and its gross margin remains stable at \~70%.

Its operating margin is lingering around 12% now, as both marketing & product development as % of revenue have been increasing. The increase in marketing expense (as % of revenue) has already been highlighted in a previous section. It is necessary to maintain the buyers’ base. So potential future improvements in the operating margin can only arise by decreasing the product development and general & administrative (as % of revenue).

**7.0 Valuation**

The two key variables when it comes to valuing a company are:

* **Revenue** \- Given that the number of active buyers hasn’t grown in the last few years, it is difficult to expect revenue growth above inflation.
* **Operating margin** \- I do think there’s room to improve the margins by reducing product development and general & administrative (as % of revenue). My assumption is that that it will increase to 14% over time.

Based on my input, the fair value of the company is **$3.2 billion ($29/share)**. This is significantly lower than the current market cap of **$5.7 billion ($51/share)**.

Anyone betting on Etsy is ultimately betting that:

1. The number of low-value products will decrease over time.
2. The number of buyers will start growing again
3. Etsy can continue increasing its take-rate, without losing sellers of high-value products.
4. The management will not engage in acquisition (as they are clearly bad at it).

"Gap shares surge as it raises guidance, touts ‘strong start’ to holiday","Hurricanes and unseasonably warm weather hit sales at Gap during its fiscal third quarter, but the apparel company still posted better-than-expected results, leading it to raise its annual guidance for a third time this year. 

Gap, which runs Old Navy, Banana Republic, Athleta and its namesake banner, is now expecting fiscal 2024 sales to be up between 1.5% and 2%, compared with previous guidance of “up slightly.” That’s ahead of the 0.4% growth that LSEG analysts had expected, and bodes well for the all-important holiday shopping season, which is now underway. 

The company is also anticipating gross margins and operating income will grow more than it previously expected.

Shares surged about 13% in extended trading.

Here’s how the nation’s largest specialty apparel retailer performed compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 72 cents vs. 58 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $3.83 billion vs. $3.81 billion expected

Gap’s reported net income for the three-month period that ended Nov. 2 was $274 million, or 72 cents per share, compared with $218 million, or 58 cents per share, a year earlier. 

Sales rose to $3.83 billion, up about 2% from $3.78 billion a year earlier.

Across Gap’s business, unseasonably warm weather affected sales by about 1 percentage point during the quarter, while storms and hurricanes led overall store sales to fall by 2%, CEO Richard Dickson told CNBC in an interview. 

“We had unusual circumstances, hurricanes, storms that led to almost 180 closures at the peak of the impact,” said Dickson, adding the storms affected Old Navy, Gap’s largest brand by revenue, the most. 

As soon as the weather turned around, sales “rebounded” and the holiday shopping season is off to a “strong start” so far, said Dickson. 

“We are energized about the holiday. Our teams are really focused on executing our plans. If we compare ourselves to where we were last year, our brands are in a much more pronounced place than they were last year,” he said. “We’ve got stronger brand identities and we’re more practiced in our playbook that we talk a lot about, driving better product, better pricing, more relevance, better consumer experience and excellence in execution.” 

Since Dickson took the helm of Gap a little over a year ago, he’s worked to turn around the business after years of declines. Under his direction, the company has leaned into nostalgic marketing and celebrity partnerships to reclaim cultural relevance. Sales have grown for the last four quarters in a row, but the company is still smaller than it once was, and critics say it needs to do more to fix its product assortment and drive full-price selling.

Here’s a closer look at each brand’s performance: 

**Old Navy:** Gap said sales at its largest brand grew 1% to $2.2 billion, while comparable sales were flat, shy of the 0.9% growth that analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. Old Navy’s kids category was particularly affected by the warmer weather, said Dickson. 

**Gap:** Gap’s eponymous banner grew 1% to $899 million during the quarter, while comparable sales were up 3% — better than the 2.3% growth Wall Street expected, according to StreetAccount. The brand has seen four straight quarters of positive comparable sales and is benefiting from better marketing and product, the company said. 

**Banana Republic:** The trendy workwear line grew sales 2% to $469 million while comparable sales fell 1%, a bit worse than the 0.8% drop that StreetAccount had expected. The brand has worked to turn around its men’s business, which drove results during the quarter. Overall, it is still focused “on fixing the fundamentals,” the company said. 

**Athleta:** The athleisure arm of Gap’s empire grew sales by 4% to $290 million while comparable sales were up 5%. The results weren’t comparable to estimates. In the year-ago period, comparable sales were down 19% at Athleta. Under its new CEO, former Alo Yoga boss Chris Blakeslee, the brand has managed to turn things around.

Manchester United stock (NYSE: MANU) – potential to grow,"According to Forbes magazine Manchester United is the second most valuable club in football, only behind Real Madrid. Only Real Madrid and Barcelona have more fans in the world. This is despite the fact that last major trophy they won is Premier League in 2013.  This was the last season with Sir Alex Ferguson at the helm – he is the best manager in history of this club. He retired and since then they are struggling a lot and underperforming. Last season they finished 8^(th) in the Premier League, this season they are 13^(th). Disappointment. They play in Europa League, second tier competition in Europe. The real money is in Champions League.

They have a tremendous potential. Big history, a lot of fans, a lot of money. They should compete for the most important throphies every year. But they didn’t in previous years and fans are angry about that.

Things are subject to change though. At the end of 2023 Sir James Ratcliffe bought 25% of club’s shares. He is the fan of the club and he has a lot to say about how the club is run. He is committed to rebuilding club and bring back glory the club aspire to. On January 2024 Omar Berrada was appointed as new CEO of the club, chief executive officer. He joined United after 13 years spent in Manchester City that was the most successful club in England during this period. On July 2024 Dan Ashworth started to work as sporting director. He worked for Newcastle and Brighton previously. He did a really god job there. In Brighton under his watch they transferred in Caicedo, Mac Allister, Cucurella, Mitoma and Trossard, they sold them later for more money. In Newcastle he was in charged when they bought Isak, Gordon, Barnes, Tonali and Botman. Great business. Recently they hired Ruben Amorim, who was successful in Sporting Lisboa. In the summer he was considered as new Liverpool FC manager, eventually they decided to go with Arne Slot who is excellent in his new role.

The future for Manchester United is bright. They have a competent people running the club. Ruben Amorim is one of the best of young managers in the world and seems to be a really good pick who is able to transform the whole club like Jurgen Klopp did it at Liverpool in the last decade. He needs time but he seems to be capable of making Manchester United great again. They were underperforming in the last 10 years but finally they addressed the issues and should be performing better. They need a time, of course, to build strong team. The thing is – if they perform on the pitch, they earn more money. I believe it is the matter of time before they are on the top. And when they reach this level, when they compete amongst really the best, their stock price should be much higher than it is now.

I think they will be a strong again very soon, they will compete and good performance on the pitch will result with big amount of cash going to the club. The next 10 years should be much better than the last 10 years. Currently their stock price is 17,47 USD. They certainly has potential for more. One more reason is – there are more and more money in football every year so this is another factor in favor of this stock.

I think that this club will compete for Premier League and Champions League in 2-4 years and it should have a huge impact on their finances. My opinion is this stock has potential to grow. Am I wrong? What do you think? I am new in the stock market so maybe I am missing something.",Positive,,3440,0

*For the quarter ended October 31, Palo Alto Networks reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.56 versus the consensus estimate of $1.47. Revenue totaled $2.14B versus the estimate of $2.12B.*

*For the quarter in progress, Palo Alto Networks expects adjusted earnings per share to range from $1.54 to $1.56, with a mid-point that matches the estimate. Its revenue projection for the second quarter ranges from $2.22B to $2.25B, which represents 13% growth year over year. The mid-point of $2.235B comes in just above the estimate of $2.23B.*   

*Second quarter Next-Generation Security ARR is expected to range from $4.7B to $4.75B, which would represent a year-over-year increase of 20%.*

*Total revenue for fiscal year 2025, which runs from August 2024 through July 2025, is expected to range from $9.12B to $9.17B. This would represent 14% growth year over year.* 

*""Our platformization progress continued in Q1, driving strong financial results,"" said Dipak Golechha, chief financial officer of Palo Alto Networks. ""As a result, we are raising our NGS ARR, revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance for the year.""*

*The board of directors also approved a two-for-one stock split, which will increase the number of authorized common shares from 1B to 2B. Trading on a split-adjusted basis is expected to begin on Dec. 16, 2024.*

I've been a big fan of PANW for the last 2 years. While the billings decline isn't great, it's been expected as the company pushes for platformization. I anticipate this to be great in the long term outlook, but short term, may seem like growth is slowing. Platformization will make their services sticky and harder for companies to leave because they'll be integrated across the business across multiple levels.

Although I'm a big fan of the stock, I will admit it's an expensive one. A lot hinges on future growth of the whole industry and if there are any signs of slowed growth, I think this one will hurt for investors buying at these levels. I'm not in cybersecurity so I'm not sure the likelihood of that, but I'd keep an eye on it. I've made several posts about PANW over the last year and my consensus is I will continue to buy monthly and if there's a large pull back down to <350 I'll look to make a large purchase with cash reserves.",Positive,,2608,0
Adani Group shares nosedive after chairman Gautam Adani charged with fraud in New York,"India’s Adani Group saw shares of its companies plunge Thursday after its billionaire chairman Gautam Adani was indicted in a New York federal court over his alleged involvement in an extensive bribery and fraud operation.

The 62-year-old billionaire and the seven other defendants have been accused of paying over $250 million in bribes to Indian government officials to secure solar energy contracts that could generate more than $2 billion in profits.

The Indian group’s flagship firm Adani Enterprises fell 10%, while the company in the eye of the storm Adani Green Energy tanked 17.28%. Adani Energy fell 20%. 

Adani Power lost 13.81%, Adani Port’s share price dropped 10%, while the group’s retail arm Adani Wilmar shed 7.87%.

The benchmark NSE Nifty 50 Index slid 0.63% in its first hour of trade.

Adani, along with two executives from Adani Green Energy Limited — his nephew Sagar Adani and Vneet Jaain — have been charged with misleading U.S. and international investors about the company’s adherence to antibribery and anticorruption standards while raising over $3 billion to finance energy projects.

The five-count indictment in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn also accused Ranjit Gupta and Rupesh Agarwal, former executives of the renewable energy firm Azure Power Global, along with three former employees of the Canadian institutional investor Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec — Saurabh Agarwal, Cyril Cabanes, and Deepak Malhotra.

CDPQ said it is aware of the charges filed. “Those employees were all terminated in 2023 and CDPQ is cooperating with U.S. authorities,” the investor said in an email.

This comes after the conglomerate spent the bulk of last year attempting to move beyond the allegations of accounting fraud and “brazen stock manipulation” made by shortseller firm Hindenburg Research. 

“Since releasing our January 2023 report identifying Adani as the largest corporate con in history, we have never wavered in our view, nor has Adani ever refuted our findings,” Hindenburg said in a statement to CNBC on Thursday.

The conglomerate had rebutted the claims, adding that it has “always been in compliance with all laws.”

These charges do not change the “strong underlying fundamentals” of India’s market or the country’s growth trajectory, said Raymond James’ head of advisory solutions and market strategy, Matt Orton. 

“Once the dust settles, there will be even better opportunities for long-term investors in India,” he said.

"After being wrong about MBLY, BOFA doubles down: ""BofA Securities Trims Mobileye Global Price Target to $12 From $13""","Max pain for options on MBLY is misleading when we have over 20% of the float shorted and underwater, the smart ones closed when it was sold off, and then some trading professionals such as BOFA securities/their-friends/people-who listen-to-them, likely opened new shorts at the bottom and tried convincing others to follow their lead.

Then as we would usually see analysts revise their predictions after the market moves (especially if they called it wrong), to make it seem they are smart or something, BOFA securities revised their predictions, to be even more wrong, showing that they are doubling down on their/people-who-listen-to-theirtrading-advice shorts and are willing to be in denial on a stock even if the market decides they are wrong.

Its not the end of the world to have entrenched shorts, since at the end of the day their losses are unlimited, and when they do close its more capital injected, the longer they waited.

Any investors here looking at European markets ?,"Let me preface this by saying I live in Europe and after dabbling initially in companies closer to home switched to US markets due to higher historical returns.

This in hindsight was an excellent decision as almost all my investments in the S&P/Nasdaq have outperformed the ones listed in Europe. So do any American guys look at European markets and see any opportunity to create alpha or are bullish on the EU markets. 

There’s an argument to be made that potentially investing into EU serves as a way to diversify and lower exposure to US markets. But I find it very hard to find good European companies with solid fundamentals that have good stock performance. Could be a myriad of reasons including liquidity, slower growth, more regulation and government oversight. 

Personally the three companies I still have in my portfolio in the EU markets is RR, NVO and LVMH. LVMH is slowing down but most likely due to luxury market turmoil and exposure to China. Additionally NVO is listed on NYSE and had uptil recently performed rather well.

So finally my question being are any guys actively eschewing the American markets for European ones or actively increasing their allocation, if so would love to know the rationale. And more importantly any particular industries or geographies that you’re targeting? ",Positive,,1311,0
Thoughts on building a 10Y high risk portfolio,"Over the past few years I’ve built a portfolio consisting of S&P, Apple, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, JPM and BRK. It has done rather well, consistently giving returns of 25%+ annually (except 2022). 

However in recent times my conviction on adding more capital to this portfolio has waned. I just feel the best days in terms of returns for some of the big tech groups may not be what they were for the past decade.

I could 100% be wrong and there is no doubt there is certain bias seeing the return of my smaller positions this year dwarfing the ones of the traditional blue chip guys if you will.

So saying all this I’m considering: 

50% S&P

10% Hood

10% Rddt

10% Rolls Royce

10% Cava

5% Lunr

5% ASTS

Quick rationale for each:

Hood: Expanding to Europe and offering very exciting new products like Hood Gold 

Rddt: Fastest growing social media, ARPU and monetisation only getting better and seeing many more people using

Rolls Royce: Slight European exposure, building low cost Nuclear plants and capturing the wide body aircraft market

Cava: Fantastic management, strong customer retention and expected to double stores in next 5 years

Lunr & ASTS: Moonshot (literally), this is just in case space works out and much more speculative 



So having said all that, what is everyone’s thoughts on this proposed portfolio allocation. Is this too risky, not enough diversification into the different sectors? Any thoughts and opinions on this would be great!",Positive,Apple,1468,1

Class action lawsuits have been raised against ASML - is it frivolous?,"Firstly, apologies for my English, it's not my first language.

My stock broker have sent me several notifications regarding class action lawsuits being levied against ASML after the last earnings report. The following are the ones I am aware of:

**11/20 - Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman LLC.**  
The complaint alleges ASML misrepresentet or failed to disclose that: (1) the issues being faced by suppliers, like ASML, in the semiconductor industry were much more severe than ASML had indicated to investors, (2) the pace of recovery of sales in the semiconductor industry was much slower than Defendants had publicy acknowledged; (3) ASML had created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to anticipated growth, while downplaying risk from macroeconomic and industry fluctiatinos, as well as stronger regulations restricting the export of semiconductor technology.

**11/20 - Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP.**

The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company's business, operation and prospects

**11/19 - Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP.**

**11/19 - The Law Offices of Frank R. Cruz**

**11/19 - Rosen Law Firm**

**11/19 - Pomerantz Law Firm**

**11/19 - Schall Law Firm**

**11/19 - Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossman**

Have also done the same with similar allegations raised against ASML. Now, it seemed to me after the earnings report that while it was not exactly a good one, I've never really assumed there was any misleading being done. Sometimes you raise guidance, sometimes you lower guidance. 

  
I assume my broker have an obligation to notify me of all of these class action lawsuits, but I've not really seen any discussion about them on any on the forums or news sites I follow, which makes me suspect this perhaps is not such a big deal? I am however not very knowledgeable on American law regarding these kinds of lawsuits.

The Bullish case for OPRA,"With Google under pressure from the DOJ, this looks like a huge potential for Opera. If Google was forced to sell Chrome, this would give smaller browsers, like Opera, a great chance to gain some market share. Also, when you look at browsers, excluding Edge and Firefox, Opera has a pretty substantial user base by comparison. They are also one of the only ""browser stocks"" that there are. At least the only one of any substance. 



On the flip side, even if Google ISN'T forced to sell Chrome, then we should see the momentum continue for GOOG.

I’ve been a long term holder of OPRA for this very reason. They have a steady growing base of 350M users and are continuing to buy up smaller browser companies. I’ve always looked at OPRA as a hedge against GOOG, at least as far as their browser is concerned. It also pays to hold because they have a great divided.

I’ve been a long term holder of GOOG too though. I think both are great companies, but I’m buying both to more or less hedge my bets.

I think OPRA has a strong chance of seeing some gains if DOJ does follow through.

Positions: GOOG: 6 shares OPRA: 100 shares

  
**TLDR**: Opera (OPRA) and GOOG (Alphabet) look like great buys right now.",Positive,,1204,0
How is Viking Therapeutics Inc not a no brainer buy right now?,"After some research, I really beleive this stock is gold:

Viking Therapeutics shared updates on its obesity treatment program for VK2735 at ObesityWeek:

Subjects achieved mean weight loss of up to 8.2% from baseline and 6.8% placebo-adjusted weight loss after 28 days of daily dosing at 100 mg. As far as I am concerned, I believe this is more effective than Mounjaro which demonstrated an average weight loss of approximately 4% of starting body weight after 4 weeks of treatment. 

Also, Oral VK2735 demonstrated a favorable safety profile, with 99% of adverse events classified as mild or moderate. The oral option could revolutionize weight loss treatments by offering greater convenience. 

Let’s look at subcutaneous VK2735 Result(or like doses): Weekly subcutaneous injections led to weight reductions of up to 14.7% from baseline. Up to 88% of treated patients achieved ≥10% weight loss, compared to 4% for placebo. Weight loss was progressive throughout the study, with no plateau at 13 weeks.

The obesity drug market is projected to grow to $130 billion by 2030, offering significant upside for VK2735. This is also important because at this size of a market, it can hold many or multiple big players. Analysts also predict Viking could become a takeover target due to its strong pipeline. This would boost the price up to 3 digits.

What’s more! The company also received praise for its liver disease treatment VK2809, which showed positive results in a Phase 2b trial for MASH (metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis), a serious liver condition affecting 22 million Americans. Reductions in liver fat ranging from 37% to 55% at 52 weeks, with response rates (≥30% reduction) as high as 88%, far exceed typical benchmarks. 

The clinical data reinforce VK2735's potential as a best-in-class obesity treatment with effective weight loss, strong safety, and durability of results. The only reason why the stock hasn’t sky-rocketed is because of fear mongering by market makers in the aftermath of RFK junior, and as far as I’m concerned, diabete and liver diseases will not go away and the desperation I’ve seen for patients to obtain these drug is mad. ",Positive,,2176,0

Ive been trading options here and there for the past couple years and seen some “odd” action before but nothing like that.

Extract: The first vulnerability relates to financial markets, which remain susceptible to sudden, sharp adjustments. While recent high-volatility episodes were short-lived and had only limited impact on the financial system, underlying vulnerabilities make financial markets prone to bouts of volatility in the future. First, record-low equity premia and compressed corporate bond spreads are signs that investors may be underestimating the likelihood and potential impact of adverse scenarios. Second, concentration of equity market capitalisation and earnings among a handful of companies, notably in the United States, has increased greatly in recent years, raising concerns over the possibility of an asset price bubble connected to artificial intelligence. Given how deeply integrated global equity markets are, negative firm-specific or sector-specific surprises could easily spill-over across the borders.",Positive,,1240,0

"Qualcomm says it expects $4 billion in PC chip sales by 2029, as company gets traction beyond smartphones","Qualcomm said on Tuesday that it expects its push into new markets to generate an additional $22 billion per year by 2029.

Of that amount, roughly $4 billion will come from PC chips, Qualcomm said at its investor day on Tuesday. The chipmaker just introduced PC processors earlier this year, when it released Snapdragon X for Windows devices.

The latest forecast marks an important milestone for Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon, who took over the company in 2021 with a promise to get past a reliance on smartphones. In fiscal 2024, Qualcomm’s handset business reported $24.86 billion in sales, about 75% of its entire chip business.

Qualcomm also said on Tuesday that automotive revenues would rise about 175% by 2029 to $8 billion, of which 80% is tied to contracts that have already been secured.

*″*We have been on this trajectory realizing that the technologies we have developed over the many years can be very relevant to a number of different industries beyond mobile,” Amon said at the investor event.

Another $4 billion in revenue will come from industrial chips and $2 billion will come from chips for headsets, a category Qualcomm calls XR. About $4 billion of the forecast is a catch-all for other chip sales, like those for wireless headphones and tablets.

Qualcomm shares are up 16% this year, trailing the Nasdaq, which has gained 26%.

Qualcomm grew rapidly over the past decade as its modems and processors became essential parts for high-end smartphones, especially those running Google Android. Qualcomm also sells modems and related parts to Apple for its iPhones.

But the company has warned investors that Apple could choose to stop buying Qualcomm parts as soon as 2027. Qualcomm said on Tuesday that its growing businesses will more than offset any losses from Apple.

Qualcomm’s strategy under Amon has been to use the technology its developed for its handset chips, like modems, processors, and AI accelerators, in new markets, including cars, PCs, and virtual reality. The investor event was the first time in years that the company has given a forecast for those new markets. Qualcomm said its total addressable market is as large as $900 billion.

“We put a strategy in ’21, and we’re not changing our strategy,” Amon said.

Laptop and desktop chips are currently dominated by Intel, which has over 70% percent of the market, according to Mercury Research. Intel reported $29 billion in PC chip sales in its 2023.

“The competitive landscape changed between the Windows and Macs,” Amon said, referring to Apple’s move in 2020 to switch from Intel to its own processors. “We saw that as an opportunity, especially as the ecosystem did not have confidence in the existing players to actually deliver a solution.”

The forecast for XR headsets also hints at the growth potential of the VR market over the next five years. Qualcomm supplies chips to many of the top headset makers, including Meta for its Quest and Ray-Bans products.

When it comes to artificial intelligence, Qualcomm calls itself an “edge AI” company, in contrast to cloud-based AI that’s typically powered by Nvidia processors. Company officials didn’t rule out introducing data center products in an interview with CNBC.

Qualcomm suggested that its mobile chips will be able to run the kind of advanced AI that’s restricted to large server farms today, an indication that that company may benefit from the AI boom down the road as the technology becomes more efficient.

“What you can run on the cloud last year, you can run on the device this year,” Durga Malladi, Qualcomm’s senior vice president in charge of planning, said at the event.

"Palantir short thesis and an analysis of its current earnings power, multiples and enterprise value","Hello friends. I hope you all spent your weekend counting the profit you made on your puts on friday. This is a long analysis with a position at the end. I will discuss Palantir and its recent explosion in share price, as well as their current earnings, multiples on said earnings and their enterprise value. I recognize that this is /r investing and thus short selling is not within everyone's risk profile. I hope it may also be of some value for those who are thinking of investing in palantir.

So here’s something you may have read somewhere: Palantir is on a meteoric rise and has made a lot of you good fellows fabulously wealthy (right…?). Since 2021 this stock has been a retail favorite and this is in large part for good reason. I’m not going to recap the business model here but the company has its foot in many o’ business  segments and has been bagging contracts left and right. They showed strong revenue growth, increasing margins (they turned GAAP profitable last year, a major milestone) and have enticed investors with promises of strong growth going forward. It is obviously a company that, for the right price, you want to be a part of.

Key phrase: *for the right price*. I am not allergic to growth investing and have often stomached high valuations if a company has an unrivaled business model and there is a strong enough runway for growth to eventually catch up with said high valuation. But I would like to make a case for Palantir being overvalued. In fact, the term overvalued does not even begin to scratch the surface of how incredibly bloated Palantir’s stock is.

For starters, let’s take into consideration palantir’s enterprise value. Despite the stock price rising roughly 50% versus its 2021 peak, Palantir’s enterprise value has ballooned much more.

*2021 peak enterprise value:* $60B at around $37 per share  
*17/11/2024 enterprise value:* $146B at around $64 per share

This is due to the increasing number of shares outstanding. In December 2020, Palantir had 978M shares outstanding. This has risen to 2.2 billion as of their most recent filing. While palantirs growth has certainly been impressive, it is worth looking at this in the context of their increased share count. Their revenue per share metrics have been the following.

End of 2020: *$1.12*  
2021: *$0.80*  
2022: *$0.92*  
*2*023: *$1.04*  
LTM: *$1.19* 

Palantir has only recently recaptured its revenue-per-share number that it had by the end of 2020. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it needs to be placed into the context of this being a perceived *growth* stock. Yes, revenue is increasing - but the amount of shares outstanding has historically kept pace with this revenue increase. As a shareholder, your claim on this revenue has historically not risen proportionally compared to its revenue growth.

Likewise, their profitability can also paint a distorted picture. Palantir adjusts the heck out of their earnings. If it is even at all possible to adjust it to paint a better picture, you better believe Karp & co will do so. Many of Palantirs shareholders are retail and cite the non-GAAP numbers as if they even remotely reflect reality. Their stock based compensation is obviously a massive expense and should be a huge red flag, but one of the most overlooked aspects I found is that of interest income. Palantir has a massive cash balance (gained through dilution - shocker, i know) that they invest in short term investments to gain interest income. This is of course nothing new, lots of companies do this. 

But consider this. In their last “blowout” quarter, Palantir gained $0.06 of GAAP EPS. This amounts to roughly $150M of net income, or about 1/1000th of their enterprise value. Of this number, $52M, or more than one third, was interest income. This is not a small footnote. Only $100M of their last quarterly earnings was actual, non-adjusted, no-nonsense operating income. Furthermore, they also paid only $7.8M of taxes on their income. This number is bound to increase over time as this is obviously a comically low tax rate. 

And then there is the valuation. Palantir trades at 55x EV / sales. This means that if *all* of Palantir’s revenue was after-tax profits and paid out as dividends, it would at their current revenues take until 2080 until investors recoup their investments. Their current EBIT margin is a little over 13%. That 55x number is mindblowingly expensive and it is almost impossible to come up with any scenario that doesnt require:

A) incredible and sustained growth in revenue

B) a steadily increasing margin, and

C) an unreasonably elevated market multiple and no collapse in overall stock market multiples for a long time

We all remember Stock McNealy’s (SUN microsystems CEO) iconic quote when he was reflecting on the dotcom bubble

*“At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don’t need any transparency. You don’t need any footnotes. What were you thinking?”*

This is somethine else entirely. 55 times sales is something that under almost no scenario can end well. Remember, you still need upside! It’s not just about justifying the current stock price, it’s about penciling out *enough upside* in the current stock price that would justify taking an extreme risk by holding this stock for an extended period of time. 

On friday, the stock market took a bath after roaring to new highs something like sixty times this year. Tesla, bitcoin and Palantir shrugged off the fear and continued to rise. Palantir added 11% and, with this move, added another five years of revenue to its elephant-sized market cap. This shows pretty clearly that Palantir is associated with meme-like risk assets. Who knows when the current market cap will reverse. It’s a game of liquidity. Musical chairs and all of the retail shareholders are playing. But one thing is clear: *their current EV / EBITDA is nearly 400x*. 

The amount of retail shareholders I see online that are convinced that this will go to $100 amazes me. My question is: Why? Based on what? Sure, it shoots up 5% a day and this leads everyone to believe it’s an amazing company. But long-term, this company has enormous shoes to fill. It is currently a penny masquerading as a $100 bill. Palantir holders are currently feasting on lobster and caviar but the bill will one day be due. And unless these guys accelerate their growth to 40% annually for a decade and increase their margins to Nvidia levels, there is only one way this ride will end. 

As it stands now, *all* of palantir’s equity is in the $5B cash position that they gained through dilution. Last quarter, the company earned $0.06 of GAAP EPS, of which $0.02 was interest income and only $0.04 was operating income. Aside from the $2 of equity per share, *all* of palantirs $65 share price is based on this $0.06 of earnings power and the future growth that the market is baking into this. In the future, growth will need to come from operating income as their cash position will not grow proportionally to keep 1/3rd of GAAP EPS in interest income. Their taxes will also go up in the future. If this is not a dotcom-level valuation, I do not know what is. 

If you currently buy a 10 year bond, you will net roughly 4.5% in interest annually. Palantirs stock nets you 1,8% - *in revenue!* 

All of this leads me to believe that this is a reasonable short opportunity. Thus, I am short for now, using graniteshares -3x Palantir (3SPA). The leveraged aspect of this product makes it vulnerable to decay if holding for long periods of time. Thus, I will look to acquire long-dated puts this week. Could get smoked some more, but that’s what makes a market.

Happy investing!",Positive,"Tesla, Nvidia",8314,2
"Sony is in talks to buy Kadokawa, media powerhouse behind 'Elden Ring'","NEW YORK/TOKYO, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Sony (6758.T), opens new tab is in talks to acquire Kadokawa (9468.T), opens new tab, the Japanese media powerhouse behind the “Elden Ring” game, two sources familiar with the matter said, as the technology giant looks to add to its entertainment portfolio.

The talks between the two sides are ongoing and, if successful, a deal could be signed in the coming weeks, the sources said.

Sony already has a 2% stake in Kadokawa and a stake in Kadokawa controlled FromSoftware, the developer of the hit fantasy action role-playing game.

Kadokawa is a huge player in Japan. I would say this is almost the equivalent of Disney buying Fox in the West.

Okta - my analysis and thoughts,"I'd appreciate any and all feedback to see if I feel I'm on track or not and your perspective on my take. I know Okta took the hit after the social engineering ""hack"", but there's no doubt they're still the leader in the IAM space. I believe there's way more upside, but I also realize that they \*could\* be a serious M&A target.

**Executive Investment Summary: Okta, Inc.**

**Overview**

Okta, Inc. is a leading provider of identity and access management (IAM) solutions, serving enterprises globally with secure authentication systems. Its strong revenue growth, cash flow, and leadership in the cybersecurity market make it an attractive acquisition target.



***Key Financial Highlights***

\- Revenue (TTM): $2.45 billion, reflecting 16.2% YoY growth.

\- Profitability:

\- Net Income: -$136 million (improved from -$355 million YoY).

\- EBITDA: -$145 million.

\- Cash Flow Positive: Despite unprofitability, generating $607M in free cash flow.

\- Cash Position: $2.2 billion; current ratio of 1.83 (strong liquidity).

\- Debt Profile: $1.297 billion in total debt; net debt of $820 million (manageable).

\- Market Cap: \~$12–15 billion.

\- Valuation Multiples: Acquisition valuation estimated at $16–18 billion, reflecting 6–9x revenue multiples.



**Strategic Acquisition Rationale**



Market Opportunity

The IAM market is expanding due to hybrid work and zero-trust security models. Okta’s leadership in this high-demand space adds immediate value to acquirers.



Synergies

1. Revenue Synergies:

\- Cross-selling within SaaS, cloud, and cybersecurity ecosystems.

\- Increases customer retention via integrated security offerings.

2. Cost Synergies:

\- Consolidation of R&D, sales, and administrative functions.



**Tax Advantages**

1. Net Operating Losses (NOLs):

\- Okta’s significant NOLs can offset taxable income for the acquirer under U.S. tax rules (IRC Section 382), reducing the acquirer’s overall tax burden.

\- For cash-flow-positive acquirers like *Microsoft* or *Salesforce*, this could be an immediate financial benefit.

2. R&D Tax Credits:

\- Okta’s investment in IAM technology qualifies for R&D tax credits, which the acquirer can leverage to reduce tax liability.

3. Capital Gains Protection:

\- If the acquirer has large realized gains in 2024, purchasing Okta could offset these with acquisition-related costs.



Timing Considerations

2024: Lower valuation; earlier synergies and immediate tax benefits from NOLs.

2025: Higher valuation but lower operational risk as Okta achieves profitability milestones.



**Potential Acquirers and Recommendations**

Acquirer: Microsoft

Timing Recommendation: Acquire in 2024

Why? Integrates into Azure AD; removes a competitor; strengthens security leadership. Early acquisition maximizes synergies and tax advantages from Okta’s NOLs.



Acquirer: Google (Alphabet)

Timing Recommendation: Wait until 2025

Why? Conservative M&A approach; IAM complements Google Cloud; may prefer profitability first.



Acquirer: Amazon (AWS)

Timing Recommendation: Wait until 2025

Why? Less urgent; would act only if Microsoft or others make a move.



Acquirer: Salesforce

Timing Recommendation: Acquire in 2024

Why? Complements Slack and Salesforce’s SaaS stack; increases enterprise value. Tax advantages can offset acquisition costs while enhancing shareholder value.



Acquirer: Cisco

Timing Recommendation: Acquire in 2024

Why? Aligns with Cisco’s cybersecurity strategy; enhances subscription revenue growth. Okta’s NOLs can be applied against Cisco’s strong operating profits.



**Valuation and Stock Price Impact**



Acquisition Valuation

2024: $16–18 billion (20–40% premium).

2025: $18–22 billion, assuming profitability.



Stock Price Impact

2024 Acquisition:

\- Stock Price Range: $95.81–$107.78 per share.

\- Upside: +29% to +45% (from \~$74.51 current price).



2025 Acquisition:

\- Stock Price Range: $107–$130 per share.

\- Upside: +44% to +75%.



**Final Recommendation**



For Acquirers

2024 Acquisition:

\- Microsoft, Salesforce, Cisco: Act now to secure market share, synergies, and tax advantages while Okta is undervalued.



2025 Acquisition:

\- Google, Amazon: Wait for profitability milestones, reducing operational risks.



For Stockholders

Hold the stock for potential 29–75% upside over the next 12–18 months through organic growth or an acquisition.

**Conclusion**

Okta is a prime acquisition target with robust growth potential, strategic synergies, and significant tax advantages for tech giants. While aggressive acquirers like Microsoft, Salesforce, and Cisco should act in 2024 to maximize these benefits, more conservative companies like Google and Amazon may wait until 2025 for improved profitability metrics. Either way, Okta presents a compelling investment with projected stock price increases of $95–$130 per share.

" UBER, Bright Future or Dim outlook?","UBER (Uber Technologies) has been beaten down quite a bit recently off the news that Donald Trump will make the barrier to entry for autonomous vehicles in the United States easier to get through, presumed from his newfound friendship with Elon Musk. Now relatively obviously UBER sold off quite a bit on this news, but I believe this isn't as bad as the market is making it out to be. I believe that Uber could easily survive mass adoptions of Autonomous Vehicles if they simply pivot to becoming the platform provider  this could be quite profitable for Uber and see their expenses come down greatly, as they no longer need to worry about paying for drivers. Uber currently sits at 4.10 FCF Yield (2.83% if you factor in SBC), and is growing FCF's at over a 100% YTD and Revenue 20% YTD. This is a rapidly growing company that's priced quite cheaply, and I believe that the downfall of UBER is greatly exagerated. If Uber can position themselves and continue their relationship with Waymo to be the platform provider, I think they're positioned very well for the adoption of Autonomous Vehicles. Would love to hear everybody's thoughts. (I own no position in UBER but am actively looking to start one soon at these prices)",Positive,,1224,0
Trying to understand the mechanics/risk of SGOV vs short term treasuries Money Market vs a HYSA and their relative safety.,"I recently have started using SGOV in my brokerage as a savings account which I pay my bills against to minimize idle cash in low returning accounts.  The returns are between 4.5-5.5% in the recent interest rate markets which is better than my High yield savings account (HYSA) so I basically have discontinued using my HYSA and just use SGOV.  I don't think I fully understand the risk after talking to a Schwab advisor so hoping to get some insight.  For comparison, here are 3 different yet similar investment vehicles that I am comparing:

1. SGOV: an ETF that is 99% invested in ultra short term treasuries; 30 day yield of 4.74%.  High liquidity as I can instantly buy/sell during market hours.  Share price increases throughout the month and then decreases on the 1st when they turn over their bonds and pay the difference in dividends.  Interest is 99% tax free at the state level due to Treasury holdings.
2. MM (SWSBX): a Schwab money market account; 30 day yield of 4.29%.  Schwab acts as middle man and fixes price at $1 per share, uses their resources to ensure stability during chaotic events.  Higher liquidity as money settles in 24 hrs.  Interest is paid directly to the account.  Interest is largely tax free at the state level due to holdings.
3. HYSA: a high yield savings account; 30 day yield of 4.65%.  Bank acts as a middle man with my money, investing it in Treasuries and Bonds and paying me a return.  Benefit: FDIC insurance.  Drawback: slow liquidity if I need to move money around quickly.  Interest is subject to State and Federal taxes.

The Schwab advisor was trying to say that SGOV is not negligible risk because it is an ETF so supply/demand sentiment can rapidly fluctuate the share price just like S&P500.  He said that this is because it is a closed end traded fund so it has a fixed number of shares that correspond to the projected value of the underlying bonds and therefore is sensitive to rapid shifts in buying and selling to balance the traded price.  Google says it is has an open ended structure same as the money market, so this already seems wrong.  I have noticed certain days I'll have a small (0.05%) loss although it does provide the anticipated 30day yield over the course of the month.  I assumed these minor losses were from buying/selling of the underlying bonds that have mismatched maturity intervals (1 weeks vs 4 week, etc).

It seems to me that there are the following risks:

1. Government / Treasury insolvency: if something like this happens it seems that all 3 of these vehicles are equally in trouble as well as FDIC insurance, so I'm not really concerned about this.
2. ETF Management Fraud: this seems like the main risk, if the SGOV board was committing fraud and not actually allocating 99% of its resources to treasuries.  The risk feels pretty low on this though but it would be unique to SGOV.
3. Return Rate Fluctuation:  If federal interest rates suddenly drop, it seems all 3 vehicles would be equally impacted although some maybe more quickly than others.  Therefore, I'm not really concerned about this either.  This also would only impact future returns not your principle.
4. Black Swan Event:  If something happened like war or pandemic outbreak and a massive shift in outflows occurred, what would happen?  Would SGOV plummet, MM be protected through Schwab backing, and HYSA be unaffected and protected with FDIC?  This is my primary concern.

TLDR:  Is it possible for SGOV return a negative value?  I understand its return is sensitive to underlying short term treasury bond prices but can you lose your principle?",Positive,,3601,0

Super Micro hires new auditor to maintain Nasdaq listing; shares pop 23%,"Embattled server maker Super Micro Computer said on Monday that it’s hired BDO as its new auditor and submitted a plan to Nasdaq detailing its efforts to regain compliance with the exchange. The shares jumped 23% in extended trading.

“This is an important next step to bring our financial statements current, an effort we are pursuing with both diligence and urgency,” Super Micro CEO Charles Liang said in a statement.

Super Micro is late in filing its 2024 year-end report with the SEC, and said earlier this month that it was looking for a new accountant after its previous auditor, Ernst & Young, stepped down in October. Ernst & Young was new to the job, having just replaced Deloitte & Touche as Super Micro’s accounting firm in March 2023.

Super Micro said it told Nasdaq that it believes it will be able to file its annual report for the year ended June 30, and quarterly report for the period ended Sept. 30. The company said it will remain listed on the Nasdaq pending the exchange’s “review of the compliance plan.”

Shares of Super Micro soared more than twentyfold over a two year period from early 2022 until their peak in March of this year. But the stock has been hammered on troubling news about its compliance with Nasdaq. Once valued at about $70 billion, the company’s market cap was at $12.6 billion at the close on Monday, following a 16% rally during regular trading.

Super Micro has been one of the primary beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence boom, due to its relationship with Nvidia. Sales last fiscal year more than doubled to $15 billion.

On Monday, Super Micro announced that it was selling products featuring Nvidia’s next-generation AI chip called Blackwell. The company competes with vendors like Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise in packaging up Nvidia AI chips for other companies to access.

Super Micro was added to the S&P 500 in March, reflecting its rapidly growing business and then-soaring stock price. Less than two weeks after the index changes were announced, Super Micro reached its closing high of $118.81.

The troubles began within months. In August, Super Micro said it wouldn’t file its annual report with the SEC on time. Noted short seller Hindenburg Research then disclosed a short position in the company, and said in a report that it identified “fresh evidence of accounting manipulation.” The Wall Street Journal later reported that the Department of Justice was at the early stages of a probe into the company.

The month after announcing its report delay, Super Micro said it had received a notification from the Nasdaq, indicating that the delay in the filing of its annual report meant the company wasn’t in compliance with the exchange’s listing rules. Super Micro said the Nasdaq’s rules allowed the company 60 days to file its report or submit a plan to regain compliance. Based on that timeframe, the deadline was Monday.

Trading SPY for gains,"First time posting, long time lurking.

I had some money ($8k only) sitting at a HYSA and earning 4% interest.
Decided to buy $8k SPY and harvest profit on a day to day basis (meaning, if stock goes up, I withdraw gains. If it goes down, I do nothing).

My HYS was returning $25+ per month. I made $60 in 2 days. And kept $8k on SPY.

What am I missing here? Even if I stop now and don’t sell for the whole month, I still did better than HYSA. 

Are there tax implications (or complications) for realizing lots of micro short term gains? 
I believe the tax bracket of HYSA and short term gains is the same. 
Will my tax be too complicated to file if I keep doing these micro profit withdrawals?

Honestly, I am a new investor (trader?), have been doing index funds and NVDA for less than 1 year (401k solid, maxed out every year, for 8+ years)

Trump Team Is Seeking to Ease US Rules for Self-Driving Cars,"[https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2024/11/17/trump-team-said-to-want-to-ease-us-rules-for-self-driving-cars/](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2024/11/17/trump-team-said-to-want-to-ease-us-rules-for-self-driving-cars/)

  
TSLA +5% overnight due to this news.

  
(Bloomberg) -- Members of President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team have told advisers they plan to make a federal framework for fully self-driving vehicles one of the Transportation Department’s priorities, according to people familiar with the matter.

If new rules enable cars without human controls, that would directly benefit Elon Musk, the Tesla Inc. chief executive officer and Trump mega-donor who has become a powerful fixture in the president-elect’s inner circle. He has bet the future of the EV maker on self-driving technology and artificial intelligence.

Current federal rules pose significant roadblocks for companies looking to deploy vehicles without steering wheels or foot pedals in large quantities, which Tesla plans to do. The Trump team is looking for policy leaders for the department to develop a framework to regulate self-driving vehicles, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly.

While the Transportation Department, through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, can issue rules that would make it easier to run autonomous vehicles, an act of Congress would clear the way for mass adoption of self-driving cars. A bipartisan legislative measure being discussed in early stages would create federal rules around AVs, two of the people said.

One candidate under consideration for Transportation secretary is Emil Michael, a former Uber Technologies Inc. executive who has spoken with Trump’s team and potential staffers, they said. The work is in its early stages and policy details have yet to be determined, they said. 

Republican Representatives Sam Graves of Missouri and Garret Graves of Louisiana have also been considered to lead the department, the people said.

The transition team didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Musk in October announced plans to produce large numbers of driverless Tesla robotaxis that lack driver controls starting in 2026. Current US regulations pose significant hurdles to Musk’s plans for the so-called Cybercab, including a cap limiting their deployment. 

He supported federal rules for autonomy on Tesla’s third-quarter earnings call, saying he’d use any role with the government to push for a process to allow autonomous vehicles to be used nationwide. The pronouncement prompted a selloff of shares of Uber and rival Lyft Inc.

Trump has since named Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency initiative to “dismantle government bureaucracy” and slash spending and regulations deemed overly burdensome.

Past efforts to come up with federal legislation to regulate autonomous vehicles have stumbled.

NHTSA currently permits manufacturers to deploy 2,500 self-driving vehicles per year under a granted exemption, but legislative efforts to increase that number to as many as 100,000 have repeatedly failed.

A bill to do that sailed through the House several years ago during Trump’s first term, but the measure has been bogged down in the Senate. An attempt during the first year of the Biden administration to merge the bill with other legislation faltered when some manufacturers tried to include language that would prevent consumers from suing or forming class-action cases.",Positive,Tesla,3575,1

My Due Diligence / Research for McDonald's Corporation (MCD)



**1. Fundamental Analysis:**

**a) Valuation:**

\- Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio: Currently at 25.5x, which is higher than the industry average of 23.2x, suggesting potential overvaluation.

\- Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio: At 8.2x, significantly higher than the industry average of 3.1x, indicating the stock may be priced too aggressively relative to its sales.



**b) Revenue Growth:**

\- McDonald's revenue growth has been sluggish in recent years, with a 5-year average growth rate of just 0.8%.

\- The company faces increasing competition from fast-casual dining options and changing consumer preferences toward healthier food choices.



**c) Margin Pressure:**

\- Rising labor costs and commodity prices are putting pressure on McDonald's profit margins.

\- The company's operating margin has remained relatively flat over the past few years, suggesting limited ability to improve profitability.



**d) Debt Levels:**

\- McDonald's has a high debt-to-equity ratio of 3.17, which is significantly above the industry average of 1.2.

\- This high leverage increases the company's financial risk and may limit its ability to invest in growth initiatives or weather economic downturns.



**e) Market Saturation:**

\- McDonald's has limited room for expansion in developed markets, where it already has a significant presence.

\- Growth in emerging markets may be challenging due to local competition and changing consumer preferences.



**2. Technical Analysis:**

**a) Trend Analysis:**

\- The stock has been in an uptrend for an extended period, potentially setting up for a reversal.

\- The 50-day moving average is showing signs of flattening, which could indicate a loss of momentum.



**b) Relative Strength Index (RSI):**

\- The RSI is currently near overbought territory (above 70), suggesting the stock may be due for a pullback.



**c) Volume Analysis:**

\- Recent trading volume has been below average, indicating a lack of conviction in the current uptrend.



**d) Support and Resistance:**

\- The stock is approaching a significant resistance level, which could act as a ceiling for further price appreciation.



**Conclusion:**



There are several factors  mentioned above, that suggest McDonald's stock (MCD) could be a potential short candidate:



1. The stock appears overvalued based on traditional valuation metrics.

2. The company faces challenges in revenue growth and margin expansion.

3. High debt levels increase financial risk.

4. Limited growth opportunities in developed markets and challenges in emerging markets.

5. Technical indicators suggest a potential trend reversal and loss of momentum.



However, it's important to note that McDonald's is a well-established company with a strong brand and global presence. Short positions carry inherent risks, and any trading decision should be made in the context of a well-diversified portfolio and with careful consideration of individual risk tolerance.

MCD and SOUN?,"https://careers.mcdonalds.com/director-ai-engineering/job/28631538

McDonald’s is ramping its AI efforts back up and all signs point to SoundHound AI as their next major partner. Their recent job posting for a Director of AI Engineering focuses on integrating Generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs) into existing systems, rather than building proprietary solutions from scratch. This aligns perfectly with SoundHound’s expertise in conversational AI and their dominance in the foodservice sector. Notably, McDonald’s previously ended its AI collaboration with IBM, leaving room for a more specialized partner to enhance its drive-thru, kiosk, and mobile ordering systems.

Adding fuel to the speculation, SoundHound recently announced on their earnings call that they’ve secured a major new client in the restaurant industry—one they are not yet able to name and negotiating with others. Given McDonald’s history of partnering with established tech leaders like Dynamic Yield and the timing of this hiring, it’s hard not to connect the dots. If this is indeed a McDonald’s x SoundHound collaboration, it could mark a transformative leap forward in customer experience with cutting-edge conversational AI.

   * Uncertainties in clinical trial outcomes and regulatory approvals.
      * FDA placed a partial clinical hold on the Phase 3 NSCLC trial due to varying results.
      * The partial FDA clinical hold on BNT316/ONC-392 and the COVID-19-influenza combination vaccine not meeting all primary endpoints are notable challenges.

This will heavily influence my decision for investment, thanks in advance. Other thoughts are also open and welcomed!",Positive,,2398,0
Self driving is coming to your favourite cars,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to dive into Mobileye (MBLY) and its role in the self-driving car industry, especially concerning partnerships with major automakers. Let's break it down.

Company Overview:

Mobileye, a subsidiary of Intel, specializes in advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies. Their EyeQ® chips and software are integral to many vehicles' safety and automation features.

Key Partnerships:

Mobileye has secured collaborations with several major car manufacturers:

Volkswagen Group: In March 2024, Volkswagen announced a cooperation agreement with Mobileye to develop and supply software, hardware components, and digital maps for the self-driving ID. Buzz AD. 

Ford: Ford has integrated Mobileye's technology into its vehicles, enhancing their ADAS capabilities. 

Zeekr: The Chinese automaker Zeekr has collaborated with Mobileye to incorporate advanced driving technologies into its vehicles. 

Porsche: In May 2023, Porsche and Mobileye announced a collaboration to introduce Mobileye's SuperVision™ automated driver-assist functions in future Porsche sports cars. 


Recent Developments:

In November 2024, Lyft announced partnerships with Mobileye and other companies to integrate self-driving cars into its ride-hailing service. This collaboration aims to advance autonomous vehicle research and development, with plans to launch self-driving taxis in Atlanta next year. 

Financial Performance:

Mobileye's stock has experienced fluctuations. As of November 8, 2024, the stock price was $16.42. Analysts have mixed opinions, with some expressing concerns over growth prospects and competition. 

Future Outlook:

Mobileye's extensive partnerships position it as a significant player in the autonomous driving sector. However, the industry faces challenges, including regulatory hurdles, technological advancements, and competition from other tech companies and automakers developing in-house solutions.

Investment Considerations:

Investors should monitor Mobileye's ability to maintain and expand its partnerships, adapt to technological changes, and navigate the competitive landscape. The company's success in these areas will be crucial for its growth and profitability in the evolving autonomous vehicle market.

What are your thoughts on Mobileye's prospects in the self-driving car industry? Let's discuss!

Tax Loss Harvesting,"Question regarding hedging with tax loss harvesting. What are the pros and cons of this strategy? What am I missing? 

Say I buy $50,000 worth of VOOG today. 

If it drops 6% and I sell, causing a $3k loss, I get to write that off on my taxes. Then, I would immediately purchase $47,000 in QQQ to avoid wash. 6% is mild correction territory, not a huge collapse, so I’d expect it to go back up soon after purchasing the QQQ and then I’m back to where I started plus $3k in negative capital gains to help my tax situation. 

If VOOG goes up, then I happily hold onto the shares and let them rise. ",Positive,,596,0
"New Nvidia AI chips overheating in servers, the Information reports","Nov 17 (Reuters) - Nvidia's new Blackwell AI Chips, which have already faced delays, have encountered problems with accompanying servers that overheat, causing some customers to worry they will not have enough time to get new data centers up and running, the Information reported on Sunday.The Blackwell graphics processing units overheat when connected together in server racks designed to hold up to 72 chips, the report said, citing sources familiar with the issue.

  
The chipmaker has asked its suppliers to change the design of the racks several times to resolve overheating problems, according to Nvidia employees who have been working on the issue, as well as customers and suppliers with knowledge of the issue, the report said without naming the suppliers.""Nvidia is working with leading cloud service providers as an integral part of our engineering team and process. The engineering iterations are normal and expected,"" a company spokesperson said in a statement to Reuters.

EQIX and DLR - are they benefitting at all from AI datacenter buildouts?,"I had been wondering if datacenter REIT's such as EQIX and DLR would benefit from the big AI datacenter rollouts - specifcally from AMZN AWS and MSFT Azure.  

Pulling up some data, I found that AMZN is listed as a top customer for both EQIX and DLR.  But MSFT/GOOGL/FB are nowhere to be found on those lists.  

I know both MSFT and AMZN have both recently acquired land to build their own datacenters which makes more sense for them in the long run. But not sure if they can scale quickly enough on their own.  

Anyone have more insight into EQIX/DLR datacenter expansion and customer base?",Positive,,593,0
My research and direction of ABNB,"Hi Everyone,

Putting a disclaimer here before people come and flame me.

I am from the tech industry with a major in data modelling and have spent the last 15 years of my time trading, investing and sharing my research with my close circle of friends. Some picks bombed rightaway and my friends relying on my research lost a shitton of money, a very small portion were really good wins  but their overall portfolio indeed is still in the green.

So based on their push( and possibly for my validation too), I have decided to post my research here so that the wider community can support the research or find holes in it. Either way, this would help me make it better everytime. Also I trade as well as invest a lot via options, so at any point of time, I might be holding a long or a short position on the stocks I reseach.

I am based out of Melbourne, Australia and use IBKR and TastyTrade for trading in US markets.

I do technical analysis too but to be honest I do not rely on technical indicators much but rather  I rely on my data modeling background to find what the data is telling me. Whether a stock is overvalued, undervalued or worth its current evalation. None of the companies that I pick to trade(go long/short) are a quick trades. Usually my trades bear fruit in 3 to 4 months or sometime much longer. Hence I use the options way. No complex options techniques but just a simple call/put to enter with low capital and stay in longer than I could afford if I had gone the cash way.

I spent a lot of time last week evaluating AirBNB stock and my numbers show that its a short as stock which should keep on declining till the next results in Feb 2025. Then the numbers that come out in Feb 2025 should decide the fate from then onwards. Anything after that would be a speculation.

Based on my  analysis of Airbnb's financial performance, market position, and the industry trend I recommend a short position on ABNB stock. While the company has shown impressive growth and resilience, several factors suggest potential downside risk in the near to medium term.

As with any data modelling, I have also posted the risk of this analysis at the end as to why this modelling could fail and please read this in its entirety before you take any action. And please note, this is not financial advise but just my research based on me looking to take a position on a stock. Feel free to enter a long or short position based on what you infer from the data points below.

As for me, I would be entering a short position when the market opens today(18th Nov).

**Financial and Fundamental Analysis:**

**1. Valuation Concerns:**  
Airbnb's current valuation appears stretched, with a forward P/E ratio of approximately 35x (as of the last reporting date), significantly higher than the industry average. This premium valuation leaves little room for error and may not be sustainable in a challenging macroeconomic environment.

**2. Slowing Growth:**  
While Airbnb has demonstrated strong revenue growth since its IPO, the rate of growth is decelerating. Year-over-year revenue growth has slowed from triple-digit percentages in 2021 to more modest double-digit growth in recent quarters. This trend may continue as the company faces tougher year-over-year comparisons and market saturation in key regions.

**3. Regulatory Headwinds:**  
Airbnb continues to face regulatory challenges in various markets worldwide. Cities like New York, Barcelona, and Amsterdam have implemented stricter regulations on short-term rentals, which could impact Airbnb's inventory and revenue potential in these key markets.

**4. Increasing Competition:**  
The short-term rental market is becoming increasingly competitive, with traditional hotel chains expanding their offerings and new entrants like Vrbo (Expedia Group) gaining market share. This intensifying competition may pressure Airbnb's margins and market position.

**5. Macroeconomic Uncertainties:**  
The travel industry is sensitive to economic conditions. With concerns about inflation, potential recession, and geopolitical tensions, consumer discretionary spending on travel may decrease, negatively impacting Airbnb's bookings and revenue.

**6. Profitability Concerns:**  
While Airbnb has recently achieved profitability, its margins remain thin. The company's efforts to expand into new markets and services may put pressure on profitability in the short to medium term.

**Technical Analysis:**

**1. Bearish Trend:**  
The stock has been in a downtrend since its peak in February 2021, forming lower highs and lower lows. This suggests persistent selling pressure and a lack of sustained bullish momentum.

**2. Moving Average Crossover:**  
The 50-day moving average has recently crossed below the 200-day moving average, forming a ""death cross."" This bearish signal often precedes further downside in the stock price.

**3. Resistance Levels:**  
ABNB stock has consistently failed to break through key resistance levels, indicating strong selling pressure at higher prices.

**4. Relative Strength Index (RSI):**  
The RSI has been trending downward and has struggled to break above the 60 level in recent months, suggesting weakness in buying momentum.

**5. Volume Analysis:**  
Recent rallies have occurred on relatively low volume, while sell-offs have seen higher volume. This pattern suggests that selling pressure remains dominant.

**Risks to Short Thesis:**

**1. Innovation and New Revenue Streams:**  
Airbnb's continued focus on product innovation and expansion into new services could drive unexpected growth and improve investor sentiment.

**2. Travel Industry Recovery:**  
A stronger-than-expected rebound in global travel could boost Airbnb's bookings and revenue, potentially leading to positive earnings surprises.

**3. Margin Improvement:**  
If Airbnb can significantly improve its operating margins through cost-cutting measures or increased efficiency, it could lead to better-than-expected profitability.

**Conclusion:**  
While Airbnb remains a leader in the short-term rental market with a strong brand and global presence, the combination of stretched valuation, slowing growth, regulatory challenges, and bearish technical indicators suggests potential downside risk. I would be initiating a short position in ABNB stock using either a March or April 2025 PUT option, with close monitoring of the identified risks to the short thesis.

Note: This analysis is based on publicly available information and market conditions as of the report date. Please conduct your own due diligence and consider their risk tolerance before making investment decisions. Don't blame me if you end up losing money on this ABNB short :)",Positive,,6712,0
Is PLTR in bubble territory?,"I don’t own any so this question just stems from curiosity. 

Its market cap was ~$15bn two years ago and is $150bn today. There’s nothing inherently concerning about that (NVDA was similar, as we all know), but its P/E ratio is 329 - is the rise unsustainable?

I understand Palantir has a lot of positive momentum from AI hype, expected defense spending under Trump, and general recovery of growth stocks as interest rates fall from their highs. These are all valid reasons to expect continued success from Palantir, but are investors irrationally exuberant?

Chris Wright - CEO of Liberty Energy and board member of Oklo Inc. tapped to be US Energy Secretary,"[Link to the article](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-names-fossil-fuel-executive-213214952.html)

>  
WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect [Donald Trump](https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump) has selected Chris Wright, a campaign donor and fossil fuel executive, to serve as energy secretary in his upcoming, second administration.

>CEO of Denver-based Liberty Energy, Wright is a vocal advocate of [oil and gas development](https://apnews.com/hub/oil-and-gas-industry), including fracking, a key pillar of Trump’s quest to achieve U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market.

>Wright has been one of the industry’s loudest voices against efforts to fight climate change and could give fossil fuels a boost, including quick action to end [a year-long pause on natural gas export approvals](https://apnews.com/article/lng-exports-biden-europe-climate-russia-3c2bfd853c0d53531a677b142b009dbc) by the Biden administration.

>Wright also has criticized what he calls a “top-down” approach to climate by liberal and left-wing groups and said the climate movement around the world is “collapsing under its own weight.” Wright, who has never served in government, has written that more fossil fuel production is needed around the globe to lift people out of poverty.

>Consideration of Wright to head the administration's energy department won support from influential conservatives, including oil and gas tycoon Harold Hamm.

>Hamm, executive chairman of Oklahoma-based Continental Resources, a major shale oil company, is a longtime Trump supporter and adviser who played a key role on energy issues in Trump’s first term. Hamm helped organize an event at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in April where Trump reportedly asked industry leaders and lobbyists to [donate $1 billion to Trump’s campaign](https://apnews.com/article/schumer-democrats-big-oil-price-fixing-collusion-07a8583a2b12e645d2860608c626cc7c), with the expectation that Trump would curtail environmental regulations if reelected.

>Mike Sommers, president of the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's top lobbying group, said Wright’s experience in the energy sector “gives him an important perspective that will inform his leadership"" of the Energy Department.

>“We look forward to working with him once confirmed to bolster American geopolitical strength by lifting DOE’s pause on LNG export permits and ensuring the open access of American energy for our allies around the world,"" Sommers said.

>Jackie Wong, senior vice president for climate and energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, called Wright “a champion of dirty fossil fuels"" and said his nomination to lead the Energy Department was “a disastrous mistake.”

>“The Energy Department should be doing all it can to develop and expand the energy sources of the 21st century, not trying to promote the dirty fuels of the last century,"" Wong said. “Given the devastating impacts of climate-fueled disasters, DOE’s core mission of researching and promoting cleaner energy solutions is more important now than ever.""

Lets talk pharma stocks,"If your not aware the entire sector has been selling off on the appointment of RFK jr for secretary of Health and Human services. Although he was nominated he still has to get approved by the senate, and the senate has big pharma supporting them. So whether he actually gets the position is to be determined.

Second if he does take the position its not going to stop or delay any current R&D, if anything it may speed up the approval process making it more efficient with less bureaucracy. People need to understand drugs and vaccines are a global business not just the US. Europe, South America and Asia have their own FDA and approve US drugs and vaccines.

Third, what matters more is who the president elect appoints for FDA commissioner. Much like the SEC has a head the FDA does too. RFK will focus on fruit loops and the FDA will focus on pharma and their business because, he doesn't have a medical degree and will quickly realize he's out of his element.

The whole sector is way oversold due to fear. Same fear that tariffs will destroy the economy.

I have $PFE leaps for $25 because this stock is way too cheap for what the business is worth. You also get a 6% yield with PFE. Their GPL pill is on the horizon(they are working on the right dosage) and their cancer business(Seagen) is worth more than their current market cap.",Positive,,1339,0

PENN - Anybody seeing this? Weekly crossed the 50-Day for first time in 3 years...,"The 8- and 21-day MA's just crossed over the 50-day on the weekly chart for the first time since 2021. This seems like a significant milestone for a stock that has been beaten down since it's failure with Barstool during the meme-stock craze.

You can see my other posts for a more in-depth thesis, but some recent news worth mentioning plus a conspiracy theory:

* Stock is up 30% in the past 6 months, yet \~15% short interest of float. 
* Q3 EPS beat, Rev didn't. Lower promo expenses. Lower losses in OSB than expected. Market share not where we want, but path to profitability is improving.
* Former Disney CTO joined the company. As a reminder, Disney owns ESPN so I see this as more buy-in from the Disney team. 
* Greenlight Capital increased their stake, it is now their 6th largest holding. Einhorn said ""we believe the market ascribes a substantial negative value to \[their OSB business\]"". And thinks OSB could add $20 per share of value.
* ESPN --- ESPN Bet account linking allows the app to know your favorite sports and fantasy team so it can create personalized bets/marketing for users. Shows further integration with Disney.
* Finally launched in NYC, mixed results for now. 
* Multiple analysts initiate coverage, showing it is a player worth tracking. Mixed opinions.

One big deal that no one talks about here is that Disney currently has $500M in warrants to purchase PENN stock. If I remember correctly, their agreement was for 3 years; if Disney doesn't like ESPN Bet's performance then they can pull the plug. Well we just crossed Year 1 and Disney's CTO has now joined PENN, they're linking ESPN accounts, they're seeing fewer losses than expected, and by 2026 (year 3) PENN believes they will have ""meaningful free cash flow"" from OSB. I have a very hard time believing that Disney would rather go through the headache of ripping out all of their integrations with PENN to find a new provider. Like the sunk cost there would be massive and why would they? The just want a faceless tech/casino provider so that they can put their own brand as the name. Fanduel/DraftKings/MGM, all of those would want their own names on the app. 

Additionally, and maybe this really gets to the tinfoil hat (I don't think it's as crazy as you might), why wouldn't Disney acquire more PENN stock? It's one of the cheapest casino operators out there right now, sports betting is becoming more mainstream (and palatable for DIS investors), and they get more upside if this thing takes off? The market for OSB continues to grow as more states legalize it and they have a massive opportunity to gain market share. Why wouldn't they want more of that upside?

Look, I've been DCA-ing into PENN over the past year, so do I want this to be right? Absolutely. But there just seem to be way too many tailwinds popping up for this valuation to make any sense with even a remotely successful ESPN Bet. DraftKings has been significantly more unprofitable ever since launching their app in 2018 and trades at 5.0x their Rev, but when PENN is negative it trades at 0.5x (other valuation methods show similar)?

Yeah I don't see that lasting, so I'll buy more. Would love to hear your thoughts.",Positive,,3189,0
Pfizer- am I stuck with take lock or is this a great value? ,"Disclosure is I am down 15% on this and it’s about 3% of my portfolio. 

I normally hate pharma stocks, but I nibbled at this one because it’s Pfizer. They impressed me with the Covid vaccine and are a well known name. This also seems very undervalued on the fundamentals and they have a potential blockbuster obesity drug (once a day pill) on the horizon. 

It’s down 4.5% today due to RFK being named HHS director, which seems like a nothing burger to me. 

6.5% dividend and from what i read, they have a decent drug pipeline coming in the future.

Alibaba shares rise 3% in premarket after Chinese tech giant posts 58% jump in profit,"Chinese e-commerce behemoth Alibaba on Friday beat profit expectations in its September quarter, citing an acceleration in growth in its cloud business unit.

Net income came in 43.9 billion Chinese yuan ($6.07 billion), compared with a LSEG outlook of 25.83 billion yuan.

Revenue reached 236.5 billion yuan ($32.72 billion), versus an analyst forecast of 238.9 billion yuan, according to LSEG data.

The company’s New York-listed shares have gained ground this year to date, up almost 17% as of Friday. The stock was up 3% in premarket trading at 11:43 a.m. London time, after the release of the quarterly earnings.

The results come at a tricky time for Chinese commerce businesses, given a tepid retail environment that reflects broader sluggishness in the world’s second-largest economy.

Markets are now watching whether a slew of recent stimulus measures from Beijing, including a five-year 1.4-trillion-yuan package announced last week, will help resuscitate the country’s growth and curtail a long-lived real estate market slump.

The impact on the retail space looks promising so far, with sales rising by a better-than-expected 4.8% year-on-year in October, while China’s recent Singles’ Day shopping holiday — widely seen as a barometer for national consumer sentiment — regained some of its luster.

Alibaba touted “robust growth” in gross merchandise volume — an industry measure of sales over time that does not equate to the company’s revenue — for its Taobao and Tmall Group businesses during the festival, along with a “record number of active buyers.”

“Alibaba’s outlook remains closely aligned with the trajectory of the Chinese economy and evolving regulatory policies,” ING analysts said Thursday, noting that the company’s Friday report will shed light on the Chinese economy’s growth momentum.

Why is Buffet buying Domino's DPZ with -$112 book value?,"Just curious if anyone has insight, maybe an accounting background.  If you have read much about Warren Buffet you know other than his wealth, his claim to fame is value investing and his company's namesake, Berkshire Hathaway all started with a takeover of a company he found that was being traded at a significant discount to book value.

So I have to ask, how is he evaluating stocks now?  I saw that they took a decent stake in DPZ and look up the financials and note the company was trading for $430 per share with a book value of -$112 per share.

Boeing starts issuing layoff notices as planemaker trims 10% of workforce,"Boeing said on Wednesday it is issuing layoff notices starting this week to workers impacted by a broader plan by the heavily indebted planemaker to cut 17,000 jobs, or 10% of its global workforce.

U.S. staff receiving the notices this week will stay on Boeing's payroll until January to comply with federal requirements that give workers 60 days' notice prior to ending their employment. News that Boeing would send out the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) in mid-November was widely expected.

“As previously announced, we are adjusting our workforce levels to align with our financial reality and a more focused set of priorities,"" Boeing said in a statement. ""We are committed to ensuring our employees have support during this challenging time.""

The notices come as Boeing under new CEO Kelly Ortberg is trying to revive production of its strongest-selling 737 MAX, after a crippling weeks-long strike by more than 33,000 U.S. West Coast workers halted output of most of its commercial jets.

Naive question: Intel 18A--what could go wrong?,"\[Disclosure: not invested in Intel yet but thinking about doing so\]

Ok, we know Intel messed up and whatever but what I do not get (so please challenge my train of thoughts):

* Intel got newest machines from ASML last year
* They use them for 18A
* Like TSMC does for AMD, Apple, etc.
* Lunar Lake is a combo of Intel's design skills and TSMC's/ASML's fab skills
* But with low margins because of latter
* However, Lunar Lake turned out pretty good, so Intel's design skills are def there
* And with 18A, Intel will have everything in-house

So, what could go wrong? Maybe Intel need quite some time to catch up and have the same fab capacity based on ASML machines but we will get there at some point.

The competition? AMD will have (long-term!) lower margins b/c of TSMC (also slower time-to-market, lower quantities), Qualcomm has lower compat and needs still to resort issues with ARM, Nvidia while capable will need some time and will have a good offer but they won't have a fab either and will face compat issues like Qualcomm. Not saying that these are dealbreakers but yeah...

What does speak against Intel: org is too messed to get it ever restructured and/or reorg too expensive, running out of money (but gov money), time, building fabs needs years, zero EUV experience, low yields for years

Edit: Intel has a lower market cap than AMD despite AMD just having design in-house, they have more assets in the GPU department but it is insignificant compared to something like Nvidia and if we talk about IGPUs Intel seem to be on par

Edit2: Would at least a new CEO just give us a bump, so we could leave again with some short-term gains?

"Intuitive Machines (LUNR) reports third quarter 2024 results, up 359% YOY, improved profitability with $4.1 million","HOUSTON, Nov. 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Intuitive Machines, Inc. (Nasdaq: LUNR, “Intuitive Machines,” or the “Company”), a leading space exploration, infrastructure, and services company, today announced its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.

Intuitive Machines CEO Steve Altemus said, “Intuitive Machines had a very strong third quarter highlighted by key wins, revenue growth, and the largest cash balance in Company history. Throughout the quarter, we continued to focus on our three core service pillars: delivery, data transmission, and infrastructure as services. These pillars provide foundational capabilities that enable the missions and goals of commercial and government exploration of the Moon.”

Q3 Highlights


Awarded $116.9 million contract through NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative, marking Intuitive Machines’ fourth contract award, more than any other CLPS vendor


Sole awardee of Near Space Network (NSN) data services contract from NASA with a maximum potential value of $4.82 billion, a transformative step for Intuitive Machines in data transmission for in-space communications and navigation


Completed vehicle propulsion system hot fire for Intuitive Machines’ second lunar mission, representing the most complex integrated test of the vehicle, in preparation for a Q1 launch from the Kennedy Space Center


Achieved $58.5 million of revenue in Q3, up 359% YoY; $173.3 million year to date, more than double all of 2023


Improved profitability with $4.1 million of positive gross margin in Q3


Ended Q3 with $89.6 million in cash, the highest quarter ending cash balance in Company history


Reported record backlog of $316.2 million, the highest quarter ending backlog in Company history driven primarily by Intuitive Machines’ fourth NASA CLPS award; backlog does not yet include the full $150 million of initial task orders for Near Space Network data services


Mr. Altemus continued, “We made progress across all three pillars by first securing another south pole lunar delivery mission, then winning the Near Space Network Services contract, and finally, continuing to mature both our LTV design in conjunction with our heavy cargo class lander. These strategic revenue streams bring our business thesis clearly into view, allowing us to focus on capturing more operational services, which we believe will provide long-tail revenues with higher margins.”

Intuitive Machines CFO Pete McGrath said, “As demonstrated in the quarter, we continue to execute on current programs while winning key awards. I look forward to guiding the Company through a new lens as CFO and focus on managing costs efficiently to drive towards profitability and achieve our financial targets.”

Deep dive into Cal-Maine - Cracking the shell: The complex World of Eggs,"**1.0 Introduction**

Every once in a while, I stumble upon a company that seems simple, yet, turns out to be incredibly complex. Cal-Maine is one that fits this description.

It is the largest producer and distributor of shell eggs in the U.S. (market share of \~14.5%), and its closest competitor is almost half its size.

Based on the description, one would expect that this is a relatively simple company. I mean, **it only sells eggs, right?**

What if I told you that the management has very little control over a business of this kind? There’s a lot to unpack, so let’s get started.

  
**2.0 The eggs**

In theory, the revenue generated would be equal to the **number of eggs sold** multiplied by the **average egg price**. So let’s have a look at these two variables:

Cal-Maine sells two types of eggs:

* **Specialty** \- These encompass a broad range of products, such as cage-free, organic, brown, free-range, pasture-raised, and nutritionally enhanced eggs.
* **Conventional** \- all other shell eggs

Why is this important? The specialty eggs are typically sold at prices and terms negotiated directly with customers. Unlike conventional, where the wholesale prices are volatile.

In 2024, the company sold 12% more dozens than back in 2018. This is more impressive than it sounds, as this is not a growing market. The demand for eggs is relatively stable, in fact, and it only grows with an increase in population. This indicates the company has slightly increased its market share during this time. To illustrate how stable the sales were in terms of volume, the 12% increase from 2018 to 2024 came without any down year.

But more importantly, the composition has changed. In 2018, about 244m dozens of specialty eggs were sold. This number increased to 401m in 2024 (**+64%**)! The % of specialty eggs of the total eggs sold increased from 24% to 35%.

Here are the prices from 2018 to 2024:

Conventional: $1.23 --> $1.04 --> $0.98 --> $0.98 --> $1.42 --> $2.73 --> $1.73

Specialty: $1.92 --> $1.93 --> $1.88 --> $1.88 --> $1.93 --> $2.40 --> 2.31

The specialty eggs are not only more expensive, but the price is significantly more stable.  Well, except for 2023. What was that about? Why were conventional eggs more expensive?

The answer is **HPAI**, known as “**Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza**” which is deadly to domestic poultry and can wipe out entire flocks within a matter of days. When there is an HPAI outbreak, there is a significant decrease in supply, which pushes the price up. This is unpredictable, and the only way to deal with this is to mitigate the risk by having multiple locations, something that Cal-Maine has.

  
The volatility of egg prices ***(per dozen)*** is significant, so despite the volume of dozens sold being stable, it is impossible to forecast the revenue of the company over time, given the volatility of the prices. But this is just the start.



**3.0 The direct costs**

The largest direct cost relates to feed. The vast majority of the corn and soybeans are purchased from suppliers in the U.S. and there is quite some volatility.

**So the management isn’t in control of the costs, nor the revenue.** That is a tough position to be in.

This is exactly why the financials are all over the place, despite the stable sales from a volume point of view.

Over the last decade:

\- The gross margin has fluctuated between **12% and 38%.**

\- The operating margin has fluctuated between **-2% and 31%.**

  
**4.0 Now what?**

So, what can the management do? Not much, other than being prepared for a bad year, as it is only a matter of time before that happens.

For that reason, the company has **no debt**.

In addition, its dividend policy is defined in relation to its profitability. The quarterly dividend payout is 1/3rd of its quarterly net income. This is definitely reasonable. Where does the remaining cash go to?

* **Acquisitions** \- There have been a total of 24 acquisitions, ranging from 160,000 to 7.5m layers.
* **Investment securities** \- Mostly U.S. Government and agency obligations, corporate bonds, and commercial paper.

I do think that the management does a good job, but the uncertainty scares away many investors.

  
**5.0 Other important topics**

**5.1 Walmart**

About 89% of the total revenue relates to sales to retail customers and 11% to food service providers.

**Walmart (including Sam’s Club)** is a major customer, accounting for 34% of its revenue. Although this might be perceived as a risk by many, I’d argue that is one of the biggest strengths the company has. Walmart has no alternative, as no competitor can quickly jump in to replace Cal-Maine.

**5.2 The special shares**

The company has two types of shares:

* **Common** (trading on the Nasdaq exchange under the ticker symbol $CALM- 44.2m shares outstanding
* **Class A** \- 4.8m shares outstanding, owned by an LLC

So, why are there two types of shares? Although both of them have the same rights in terms of dividends and liquidation, each class A shares is entitled to **10 votes.**

This means the class A shareholders have **52% voting rights.**

**6.0 Valuation**

So, how does one value a company of this kind when not only there are many pieces of the puzzle, but the pieces are changing?

Does a DCF make sense? Not really. There is no point attempting to forecast the next 5 or 10 years, when the next 2 are uncertain.

I’d argue that this is a company that could be treated like a bond, where the coupon is fluctuating, and a dividend discount model would be an appropriate way to value it. Except, instead of using the dividend, I’ll use FCF - SBC.

  
So, how to estimate the FCF? There will always be good and bad years in a company of this kind. So using the average of the last decade would be a good place to start.

  
FCF - SBC: $180m

Growth in perpetuity: 8%

Discount rate: 9%

Value of the business: $3 billion

\+ Cash: $182m

\+ Non-operating assets: $539m

\- Value of equity options: $12

**Value of the company: $3.7 billion ($76/share)**

This is slightly lower than the current market cap of **$4.6 billion ($91/share)**.



So, anyone who is betting on Cal-Maine is ultimately betting that:

1. The egg market will remain stable, from a volume point of view - **which is very likely**
2. The future prices (eggs, corn, soybeans) will be slightly more favorable on average than the past prices - **which is uncertain**
3. Walmart will remain a key customer - **which is likely**
4. There will be no significant HPAI outbreak that will harm Cal-Maine - **which is uncertain**
5. The class A shareholders votes will be in the interest of all shareholders - given the past decisions, **this is likely**
6. The management will continue to run the company safely, without any significant debt position - **which is likely**

Based on the list above, there are two uncertainties, prices and HPAI outbreaks. Quite a lot to digest, for such a “simple” business. It’s only eggs, right?

I hope you enjoyed this post, feel free to share your thoughts.

Disney narrowly beats estimates as streaming boosts entertainment segment,"Disney reported its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings Thursday, narrowly beating analyst estimates as streaming growth helped propel its entertainment segment. 

Here is what Disney reported compared with what Wall Street expected, according to LSEG

Earnings per share: $1.14 adjusted vs. $1.10 expected

Revenue: $22.57 billion vs. $22.45 billion expected

Disney’s net income increased to $460 million, or 25 cents per share, from $264 million, or 14 cents per share, during the same quarter last year. Adjusting for one-time items, including restructuring and impairment charges, Disney reported earnings per share of $1.14. 

Total segment operating income increased 23% to $3.66 billion compared with the same period in 2023.  

Revenue for the entertainment segment – which includes the traditional TV networks,  direct-to-consumer streaming and films – increased 14% year over year to $10.83 billion after a hot summer at the box office.

Disney Pixar’s “Inside Out 2” became the highest-grossing animated movie of all time this summer, surpassing Disney’s “Frozen II” at the box office. Meanwhile, its “Deadpool & Wolverine” became the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time, surpassing Warner Bros. Discovery’s “Joker.”

The films added $316 million of profit for the entertainment segment during the quarter. Overall, the entertainment segment reported nearly $1.1 billion in profit.

Revenue for Disney’s sports segment, made up primarily of ESPN, was flat. ESPN’s profit fell 6% due in part to higher programming costs associated with U.S. college football rights as well as fewer customers in the cable bundle. 

Disney’s combined streaming business, which includes Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, saw profitability improve during the quarter after turning its first profit during the fiscal third quarter, three months earlier than expected. The division reported an operating income of $321 million for the September period compared with a loss of $387 million during the same period last year. 

Disney joined its peers, including Warner Bros. Discovery, Netflix, Comcast and Paramount Global in adding streaming subscribers during the most recent quarter. 

Disney+ Core subscribers – which excludes Disney+ Hotstar in India and other countries in the region – grew by 4.4 million, or 4%, to 122.7 million. Hulu subscribers grew 2% to 52 million. 

Average revenue per user for domestic Disney+ customers dropped from $7.74 to $7.70, as the company had a higher mix of customers on its cheaper, ad-supported tier and wholesale offerings. 

Meanwhile the company’s traditional TV networks business continued to decline as consumers leave pay TV bundles behind in favor of streaming. Revenue for the networks was down 6% to $2.46 billion. Profit for the segment sank 38% to $498 million. 

The experiences segment, which includes Disney’s theme parks as well as consumer products, saw revenue grow 1% to $8.24 billion. 

The domestic parks’ operating income rose 5% to $847 million, helped by higher guest spending at the parks and cruise lines. 

Operating income at the international parks, however, fell 32% due to a decline in attendance and in guest spending as well as increased costs. 

The company said Thursday it’s “confident in the long-term prospects for the business,” and provided an outlook that includes its fiscal 2025, 2026 and 2027.

Disney expects a “modest decline” in Disney+ Core subscribers during the fiscal first quarter of 2025 compared with the prior quarter.

Full-year profit in the entertainment streaming business, which excludes ESPN+, is expected to see an increase of roughly $875 million compared to the prior fiscal year and to increase by a double digit percentage in its fiscal 2026.

Disney also anticipates double-digit percentage growth in fiscal 2025 for its entertainment segment.

The experience segment, however, is expected to see just 6% to 8% profit growth in the coming fiscal year compared to the prior year. Disney noted the fiscal first quarter will see a $130 million hit due to the impact of Hurricanes Helene and Milton, as well as a $90 million impact from Disney Cruise Line pre-launch costs.

"AMD to lay off 4% of workforce, or about 1,000 employees","AMD said on Wednesday that it will lay off 4% of its global staff as the longtime computer chipmaker seeks to gain a stronger foothold in the growing artificial intelligence chip space dominated by Nvidia.

*″*As a part of aligning our resources with our largest growth opportunities, we are taking a number of targeted steps that will unfortunately result in reducing our global workforce by approximately 4%,” an AMD representative said in a statement. “We are committed to treating impacted employees with respect and helping them through this transition.”

AMD had 26,000 employees at the end of last year, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing.

AMD is the second-biggest producer of graphics processing units, or GPUs, behind Nvidia. The company has said AI represents one of its largest growth opportunities. AMD stock is down 5% in 2024 while Nvidia shares are up 200%, making it the most valuable publicly traded company in the world.

AMD produces powerful AI accelerators for data centers, including the MI300X, which companies such as Meta and Microsoft purchase as an alternative to Nvidia-based systems. But Nvidia dominates the market for powerful AI chips, with over 80% market share, partially because it developed the core software that AI engineers use to develop programs such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

AMD said in October it expects $5 billion in AI chip sales this year, about a fifth of the $25.7 billion in total sales FactSet projects for AMD’s 2024. AMD believes the total market for AI chips will be $500 billion by 2028, but its total sales are currently dwarfed by Nvidia, which FactSet expects to post $125.9 billion in revenue for calendar year 2024.

GPUs were originally developed for gaming, which is lagging at AMD. AMD’s gaming segment is expected to decline 59% in 2024 to $2.57 billion in revenue, according to FactSet.

AMD also makes processor chips for laptops, desktops and servers, competing primarily with Intel. Its share of server CPU sales rose nearly 3% on an annual basis in the third quarter to 34%, according to Mercury Research.

Why do shareholders of a company with positive shareholder equity still receive nothing in the event of bankruptcy?,"Hello everyone,

I’m currently looking at the situation with Spirit Airlines. I’m not a shareholder, but I was interested in the fact that they report about $807m in shareholder equity.

Spirit now claim that the bonds due in 2025 and 2026 are a problem, and they must renegotiate, likely resulting in a wipeout of shareholders and Chapter 11.

My question is, if the company has equity value remaining, why do the shareholders end up with nothing? Is it because the value of those assets would likely not stack up to the value of liabilities when liquidated/sold off (although I would assume depreciation accounts for that)? Or is it because the costs incurred during the bankruptcy process would exceed the shareholder equity in the company?

I can’t imagine the process would cost them $807m…

Cisco reports fourth straight quarter of declining revenue,"Cisco reported a fourth straight quarter of declining revenue even as results topped analysts’ estimates. The stock slipped about 1% in extended trading.

Here’s how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:

* **Earnings per share:** 91 cents adjusted vs. 87 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $13.84 billion vs. $13.77 billion expected

Cisco’s revenue dropped 6% in the quarter ended Oct. 26, from $14.7 billion a year earlier, according to a statement. Net income fell to $2.71 billion, or 68 cents per share, from $3.64 billion, or 89 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago.

Networking revenue plunged 23% to $6.75 billion, slightly below the $6.8 billion consensus of analysts surveyed by StreetAccount.

Security revenue doubled to $2.02 billion, topping the StreetAccount consensus of $1.93 billion. Cisco’s revenue from collaboration was $1.09 billion, a bit below the $1.04 billion consensus estimate.

Chuck Robbins, Cisco’s CEO, said on a Wednesday conference call that orders from large-scale clients for artificial intelligence infrastructure exceeded $300 million in the quarter. Server makers such as Dell and HPE have also focused on sales of hardware that can help clients implement generative AI.

“We have earned more design wins and remain confident that we will exceed our target of $1 billion of AI orders this fiscal year from web-scale customers,” Robbins said.

U.S. government agencies have delayed deals with Cisco, rather than scrapping them altogether, Robbins said.

During the quarter, Cisco acquired security startups DeepFactor and Robust Intelligence.

Cisco lifted its full-year guidance to $3.60 to $3.66 in adjusted earnings per share on $55.3 billion to $56.3 billion in revenue, up from a prior forecast of $3.52 to $3.58 in EPS and $55 billion to $56.2 billion in revenue. Guidance would indicate projected revenue growth of 3.3% at the middle of the range.

Analysts expected adjusted earnings for the year of $3.58 per share on $55.89 billion in revenue.

As of Wednesday’s close, Cisco’s stock was up 17% year to date, while the S&P 500 index, is up around 26% over that stretch.

"Robotics, Cyber-Security, Beverage and Industrial Stocks ","I wanted to buy some individual stocks today from 4 different industries. After some extensive research I landed on these 4 industries: robotics, cyber-security, beverages and industrial. 

The four companies I landed on were SYM, S, BROS, and ATMU. 

Symbiotic, $SYM is a robotic warehouse company located in Massachusetts. Its number one customer is Walmart and is also partnered with Target, Unfi. They are showing strong revenue growth and on the verge of positive net income. At 20 billion dollars it seems fairly valued when compared to other robotics companies like ABB which has a 100 billion dollar market cap. I think SYM has the opportunity to take some more of their market share. 

$S, SentinelOne, is a cyber-security company worth roughly 9 billion dollars. It can be compared to Cloudflare and Palo Alto. At about a quarter of the valuation, there is a lot of room for growth. 

$BROS, Dutch Bros is a coffee / beverage company that has been expanding like wild fire. It opened over 30 new shops last quarter. And just popped 30% after last earnings. I believe this company is on a similar trajectory as Starbucks, and seems to have even more momentum than Starbucks, Gen Z is obsessed with their drinks and the line is always very long. A risky growth play, but intriguing. 

$ATMU is a water filtration company valued at 3.6 billion and has a PE of 20 and has growing revenue and net income. A strong value play in my opinion, and very highly regarded by analysts. Seemed like a no brainer to me. 

Would love to hear your opinions on the stocks, and would like to know if you have better options in these 4 industries. I opened a small position today in these 4 stocks. ",Positive,,1689,0

PG&E to deploy nuclear-specific AI at Diablo Canyon plant ,"Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) is deploying Atomic Canyon’s artificial intelligence-powered solutions for the nuclear energy sector at PG&E’s Diablo Canyon Power Plant, marking the inaugural commercial installation of the first on-site generative AI deployment at a U.S. generating facility.

Atomic Canyon’s Neutron Enterprise generative AI solution, built and running on NVIDIA’s full-stack AI platform, is being deployed at Diablo Canyon for document search and retrieval processes. PG&E also says the AI technology will deliver cost savings and improved operational efficiency.

Federal and state regulations require utilities that operate nuclear power plants to manage “billions of pages” of technical documentation, PG&E said, which are spread across multiple systems. Power plant personnel must spend both time and resources to retrieve this essential data – something PG&E argues the AI will help avoid. Neutron Enterprise is meant to integrate with Diablo Canyon’s systems, using the latest optical character recognition (OCR), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and AI-powered search technology meant to cut search times from hours to seconds.

“As the first nuclear power plant to implement Neutron Enterprise using the NVIDIA platform, we’re proud to lead the way in bringing cutting-edge innovation to our operations,” said Maureen Zawalick, vice president of business and technical services at Diablo Canyon Power Plant. “Atomic Canyon’s AI solutions will enable faster data retrieval, boosting collaboration and ensuring continued safe, but more efficient operations. Accessing critical information in seconds will let us focus on what truly matters—delivering reliable clean energy safely and affordably.”

The Neutron Enterprise solution is powered by Atomic Canyon’s FERMI family of AI models, developed in collaboration with the Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory and specifically designed for the nuclear energy sector.

As California’s only remaining nuclear power plant, Diablo Canyon provides nearly 9% of the state’s electricity and generates 17% of its zero-carbon energy. The California Energy Commission estimates that power demand across the state will rise roughly 43% in the next 15 years, which PG&E argues will make Diablo Canyon a more critical clean energy asset.

Volkswagen raises Rivian stake by 16% to $5.8 billion,"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rivian-volkswagen-group-launch-5-211929826.html

(Reuters) -Volkswagen Group raised its investment in Rivian by 16% to $5.8 billion and the two companies said on Tuesday they were launching their previously announced joint venture to develop electric vehicle architecture and software.

The companies said in June that VW would invest $5 billion in Rivian. Shares in the U.S. EV maker rose nearly 4% in extended trading.

The joint venture aims to integrate advanced electrical infrastructure and Rivian's software technology for future EVs of both companies, across all relevant vehicle segments, including subcompact cars, the firms said.

Volkswagen plans to invest the $5.8 billion in Rivian and the joint venture by 2027, including an initial $1 billion convertible note.

The Audi-parent will also invest $1.3 billion for intellectual property licenses and an equity stake and up to $3.5 billion in future equity, notes and debt, all tied to specific milestones.

Rivian's Chief Software Officer Wassym Bensaid and VW Group's Chief Technical Engineer Carsten Helbing will lead the joint venture named Rivian and VW Group Technology LLC.

Developers and engineers in the JV will be based initially in Palo Alto, California with three additional sites under development.

The joint venture will use Rivian's existing tech to launch Rivian's R2 in the first half of 2026 and potentially debut Volkswagen Group models as early as 2027.",Positive,Rivian,1468,1
Supermicro - hold or sell - my strategy,"Disclosure of related position: I bought Supermicro for my growth and momentum trading strategy back in January 2022 for $43.20 (split aligned $4.32) and then doubled down the 6th of September 2022 for $64.22 (split aligned $6.422). Then I partially sold 15th May 2023 at 137.19 (split aligned 13.719), 10th of January 2024 at  $355 (split aligned $35.5) and 12th of September 2024 at $442.13 (split aligned $44.231).

I took out already much more than I did put in, but still own a large position of SMCI. Now I'm in the process of changing the rule for a complete selling in my strategy. As you can see in my disclosure I left a lot of money on the table which already made me change the way I take partial gains.

But let's speak about Supermicro here. What happened:

Hindenburg took a short position and published a report about bookkeeping fraud at Supermicro. Then the auditor, Ernst & Young, resigned. The company is now behind on the mandatory reports to the SEC two quarters. This weekend is the deadline for a de-listing on the NASDAQ. The stock tanked 82% from the high. According to the actual published numbers (which may be corrected) the stock is now almost as cheap as when I bought it first, even if the value more than quadrupled still after the loss of 82%.

Now, Hindenburg at first only cited ex employees as source. But the resignation of Ernst & Young as auditor was probably an ace in Hindenburgs sleeve. I personally know Ernst & Young, they are not exactly my favorites. Since they published the report there was a mass of bad news published, the exact same analysts that hived Supermicro to the SP500 more or less exactly at the high say now it is junk after that loss.

I was thinking about Apple. In the time it would have been most profitable to buy everybody shouted sell. The stock lost more than once 80% of its market value.

Supermicro owns a lot of very unique patents. Their liquid cooled systems take less time to build and are more modular than any of the other competitors systems, Dell being its main competitor. Even if they reported some orders too early as sale they sell a lot lot more than a few years ago thanks to AI. And they will probably sell a lot more.

I think it is very possible that we cannot trade Supermicro on the Nasdaq next week. An that means it will fall out of the SP500 and the NASDAQ 100, putting a lot of sell pressure on the ETF that mirror those indices. Or, Supermicro presents a new auditor and a plan to deliver the reports to the SEC by this weekend.

It is probably a binary bet that will be resolved soon. In my opinion the upside (probability to win multiplied with amount to win) is much higher than the downside (probability to lose multiplied with amount to lose). And even if it is delisted, it is far away from being worthless. Probably it will be a target for Dell.

For example, if you were 70% stock 30% cash/bonds prior to the bull market, have you adjusted your ratios in response to the current valuation (ex to 40% stock 60% cash) or stick with 70%/30%?

My personal strategy was extremely aggressive during the previous bear market (100% of my networth minus 10k for emergencies was in QQQ).

Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, said: “In the third quarter 2024 we once again executed against our end-to-end space strategy with successes and key achievements reached across small and medium launch, as well as space systems. Revenue grew 55% year-on-year to $105 million and we continue to see strong demand growth with our backlog at $1.05 billion. Significant achievements for the quarter included signing a launch service agreement for multiple launches on Neutron with a confidential commercial satellite constellation customer; successfully launching twelve Electron launches year-to-date, making 2024 a record year for launches with more still to come; signing $55 million in new Electron launches, further cementing Electron’s position as a global launch leader; and being selected by NASA to complete a study contract for a proposal to retrieve samples from Mars and return them to Earth as part of a world-first mission. We expect to close out the year strongly with more Electron launches scheduled in November and December, alongside continued progress across Neutron and space systems, that is behind our guidance for a record $125-$135 million revenue quarter in Q4.”

**Business Highlights for the Third Quarter 2024, plus updates since September 30, 2024.**

**Electron:**

* Achieved a new annual launch record of 12 Electron launches to date, with more scheduled across November and December 2024. Electron is the world’s third most-frequently launched rocket annually by vehicle type and remains the United States’ second most-frequently launched rocket annually.
* Signed several new Electron launch contracts in Q3 2024 with a total value of $55m, demonstrating an increased average selling price of $8.4m and showcasing a 67% pricing increase since the rocket’s debut launch.
* Successful Electron launches for three separate commercial satellite constellation operators in Q3, including two missions launched within just eight days. In addition to these, Electron’s most recent mission, launched in the fourth quarter on November 5 ^(th) , 2024, included an expedited turnaround of just 10 weeks between contract signing and launch.

**Neutron:**

* Signed a launch service agreement for multiple launches on Neutron with a confidential commercial satellite constellation operator that signifies the beginning of a productive collaboration that could see Neutron deploy the entire constellation.
* Announced a federal defense contract that supports Neutron and the development of its Archimedes engine with the U.S. Air Force’s Research Laboratory.
* Doubled engine testing cadence for Archimedes over the quarter at Rocket Lab’s engine test site in Mississippi, alongside strong production execution at the Company’s Engine Development Complex in California which included multiple engines manufactured, assembled, and shipped for engine testing.
* Significant progress made across Neutron’s structures and infrastructure, including the completion of construction on the rocket’s Assembly, Integration, and Test (A.I.T.) facility in Virginia.
* Well-positioned to on-ramp to the U.S. Space Force’s National Security Space Launch (NSSL) Lane 1 program, which began accepting proposals in November 2024 to on-ramp new launch providers to an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract valued at $5.6 billion over a five-year period.

**Space Systems:**

Liberty Media to spin off assets; CEO Greg Maffei to step down at year-end,">Liberty Media announced Wednesday it’s spinning off most assets besides Formula One auto racing into a separate publicly traded company, called Liberty Live, and that CEO Greg Maffei is stepping down at year-end. Chairman John Malone will become interim CEO of Liberty Media. Liberty Media’s investor day is set to take place on Thursday in Manhattan. After the split, Liberty Media will hold Formula One, which Liberty acquired in 2016 and later spun out as a tracking stock, and MotoGP, upon the closing of that transaction. Liberty Live will hold roughly 69.9 million shares of Live Nation Entertainment, sports experiences provider Quint and certain other assets, according to a release.

>The company also announced cable company Charter Communications  would acquire Liberty Broadband in an all-stock transaction. In September, Liberty Broadband went public with its aspirations to merge with Charter, in a move to simplify Malone’s portfolio. Liberty owns 26% of Charter shares. The Liberty Media and Liberty Live split is expected to be completed in the second half of 2025, and the sale of Liberty Broadband to Charter is expected to be completed in mid-2027. “The split-off of Liberty Live Group into a separate public entity will simplify Liberty Media’s capital structure, should reduce the discount to net asset value of our Liberty Live stock and enhance trading liquidity at both entities,” Maffei said in a release.

>Following today’s announcements at Liberty Media and Liberty Broadband, all the Liberty acquisitions completed during my tenure are now in structures where shareholders can have more direct ownership in their upside,” Maffei said in a separate release. “While it’s never easy to leave an organization as dynamic as Liberty, I am confident that this is the right time.” Maffei has been part of Liberty since 2005 and has various positions on boards of the company’s assets, including Charter. Malone is a pioneer of the cable industry, long known as the “cable cowboy,” and has kept his hand in various media assets over the years. He’s been an independent director of Warner Bros. Discovery — initially through Discovery, before the company merged with Warner Bros., under his advisement.

"Waymo opens robotaxi service to anyone in Los Angeles, marking its largest expansion yet","Alphabet-owned Waymo is removing the waitlist for its self-driving service in Los Angeles, marking its largest expansion yet.

Starting Tuesday, anyone in LA will be able to use the Waymo One app to hail a self-driving robotaxi throughout nearly 80 square miles of Los Angeles County, the company said. That includes the 300,000 Angelenos who have been on Waymo’s waitlist.

With more than 3.8 million people, LA marks the third and largest city where the company’s robotaxi service is now fully available. It follows San Francisco, where Waymo One opened citywide in June. The company opened the service in Phoenix in 2020.

“Now is an exciting time to welcome everyone in Los Angeles along for the ride,” Tekedra Mawakana, co-CEO of Waymo, said in a news release Tuesday. “Our service has matured quickly and our riders are embracing the many benefits of fully autonomous driving. We’re so grateful to all of our first riders in LA, and we can’t wait to serve more riders soon.”

The company has been rapidly expanding its operations over the last year thanks to additional funding.

Waymo closed a $5.6 billion funding round in October to expand its robotaxi service across the U.S. The autonomous vehicle venture is owned by Google parent Alphabet, which led the series C investment in Waymo, alongside earlier backers including Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity, Perry Creek, Silver Lake, Tiger Global and T. Rowe Price.

The robotaxi company now sees more than 150,000 paid rides per week across its three markets via the Waymo One app, the company said Tuesday. That’s up from 100,000 in August.

Waymo in September announced that it partnered with Uber to launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in 2025. The next-generation robotaxi from Waymo is a Geely Zeekr that’s equipped with custom sensors and an AI “driver.” Waymo also recently agreed to a multiyear strategic partnership with Hyundai that will add the South Korean automaker’s Ioniq 5 electric vehicle to its robotaxi fleet.

The Waymo One service has been embraced by some women who have safety concerns about riding with unknown human drivers. It has also been used by parents to send their teens to school.

Why do some chapter 11s wipe out shareholders while some don’t ? ,"I know the majority of chapter 11’s will basically make stock value 0 and leave stock holders with nothing. However, in cases like American Airlines or Hertz they were able to keep equity for shareholders. I know these two examples are a bit different in that Hertz was able to raise money fast and AA was able to do a merger. Does this have to do with restructuring and whether or not they can reduce debt enough? Also what are the benefits of letting shareholders keep equity if they’re already filing for chapter 11?

Netflix ad-supported tier has 70 million monthly users two years after launch,"Netflix’s cheaper, ad-supported tier has reached 70 million global monthly active users two years after it was launched.

The company said Tuesday that more than 50% of its new sign-ups are for ad-supported plans in countries that offer the option. Netflix said it continues “to see positive momentum and growth across all areas of the business,” adding it has seen “steady progress across all countries’ member bases.”

Netflix launched the option in November 2022 as one of its responses to a slowdown in subscriber growth.

Recently, subscriber growth hasn’t been an issue. Last month Netflix reported it added 5.1 million subscribers during the third quarter, beating Wall Street estimates. In total, Netflix counts 282.7 million memberships across all of its pricing tiers.

Beginning next year, Netflix said it will no longer update investors on its subscriber numbers as it shifts focus toward revenue and other financial metrics as performance indicators.

When Netflix launched its ad platform two years ago, the company said Nielsen would rate its content.

Netflix in May announced it would air two National Football League games on Christmas Day this year as part of a three-year deal. On Tuesday it said it sold out of its ad inventory for the two live games.

Netflix also said it’s brought on FanDuel and Verizon as advertisers for the games. FanDuel will become the exclusive pregame sportsbook betting partner, Netflix said, and will have a sponsored in-show feature.

Media companies have been focusing on ad-supported strategies for their streaming options that woo customers with cheaper plans and also offer advertising revenue that can help move the streaming businesses toward profitability. While the ad market has been slow for traditional TV, it has grown for streaming and digital businesses.

Netflix offered its last update on its ad-supported tier in May, when it said it reached 40 million global monthly active users, nearly doubling the figure it had shared in January. That announcement came during Upfronts, when media companies make their pitches to advertisers.

Netflix also announced in May it would launch its own advertising platform, ending a partnership with Microsoft for that technology. It’s rolled out the platform in Canada and plans to launch it in the U.S. by the end of the second quarter next year. It plans to set the platform live everywhere by the end of 2025.

Elon Musk’s Trump bet has paid off so well that Tesla is now worth more than most of the rest of the car industry combined,"[https://fortune.com/2024/11/11/elon-musk-donald-trump-election-tesla-auto-industry-carmakers-market-value/](https://fortune.com/2024/11/11/elon-musk-donald-trump-election-tesla-auto-industry-carmakers-market-value/)

Who profits most from car industry?,"As title suggest,

I'm wondering which segment within the car industry brings in the most profit?

I recently revisited the sector since my GPI holding is already over 200%. My thesis back then was the diversification between new/used/maintenance & international as it was something I felt important to be exposed to. However I am left uneducated on the overall industry.

I see car dealership stocks climbing higher and higher despite headlines of slowing sales or negative growth.

"NICE Ltd., an undervalued AI stock that is positioned well whether or not generative AI even works","There may be literally only one stock that has not been swept up by AI hysteria, despite pivoting their business model to adapt to the prospect of generative AI - NICE Ltd.

NICE Ltd., headquartered in Ra'anana, Israel, provides advanced cloud-based software for customer experience (CX) and financial crime prevention. NICE specializes in AI-driven platforms like CXone, which supports customer engagement through AI-based customer routing, automated interactions, and real-time analytics. Their Enlighten AI suite enhances contact center operations by helping agents offer more responsive, personalized service. They also offer solutions for digital evidence management and fraud detection, serving sectors like public safety, law enforcement, and financial compliance.

NICE has been quietly rising ahead of their **earnings call tomorrow**, currently trading around $200. However, it is still WELL off of their high of $250. Their stock price the last several months has seen a sharp decline due to their longtime CEO, Barak Eilam, announcing his departure that will take place at the end of 2024. NICE, in my opinion, has taken an unfair beating for this news. Their replacement, Scott Russell, is an interesting hire due to his experience in the APAC market at a company the size of SAP and his international experience.

NICE has not penetrated the European and APAC market well at all, and this could be an incredible opportunity to grow revenue in those markets with his appointment. They are already well entrenched in some of the largest F500 companies in the Americas. It's about time they start looking abroad.

To speak on the tech itself, and whether or not generative AI will work in this industry, that itself represents an interesting scenario for NICE. In my opinion, whether or not AI works, NICE is positioned well. Their last earnings call, analysts asked Barak specifically about whether or not their generative AI systems are being used by their customers. He mentioned their proprietary ""co-pilot"", internally-faced AI used by customer service agents is being heavily utilized, and bookings is up 100% YOY for the technology, but that there is definitely still some hesitancy to roll out a generative AI customer service platform to the end consumer. This is fine, in my opinion, because if conceptually it doesn't work, NICE's technology is needed, and will serve the market as it has for years. If generative AI is the solution this industry will need, then they are even better positioned for that against the market with their technology. 

Some of the risks that I've heard. One is valid the other isn't. It is an Israeli based company, so there are going to be risks endemic there that are inevitable, which is valid.

I also hear about how large companies like Microsoft and Amazon will enter this market and take away market share. This is really unlikely. Microsoft, for example, tried to do a CRM tool and it is truly dogshit and has close to zero market share. And CX software requires much more domain expertise than doing a CRM tool, which they failed spectacularly at. 

I'll spare you the valuation work but...Anyway, stock is fairly priced close to $300, and is currently trading at $200. I got in at $165 earlier this year, but this is still a great opportunity.

"Deep dive into eBay - The Rise, The decline and The Reality Check","**1.0 Introduction**

eBay was originally called “AuctionWeb” when it launched in 1995. Its founder, Pierre Omidyar, created it as part of his website to experiment with online auctions. He listed his broken laser pointer for sale and sold it for **$14.83**. When he asked if the buyer understood the laser pointer was broken, the buyer responded that he was a collector and was still interested.

In 1997 the name was changed to eBay, and the rest is history.

The most expensive item ever sold on eBay is the **Gigayacht**, a 405-foot luxury yacht designed by Frank Mulder. It was purchased for **$168 million** by the Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich.

The auctions for a lunch with Warren Buffett also took place on eBay, with the 2022 auction being won by a bid of $19 million.



**2.0 Competition**

eBay has been primarily known as the auction go-to-place, as well as the place to go for 2nd hand items. Although there is an overlap with its competitors, there is no doubt that it dominates the 2nd hand market, especially for trading cards and collectibles and it can be labeled as the market leader in Recommerce and auctions.

Its competition comes in different forms:

* **Amazon & Walmart Marketplace** \- Global eCommerce platforms focused on new products sold by businesses and third-party sellers.
* **Facebook Marketplace & Craigslist** \- Local Recommerce platforms enabling individuals to buy/sell used items within their communities.
* **Etsy** \- Global eCommerce with a focus on handmade and unique products, though it includes some Recommerce elements for vintage goods.

eBay supports eCommerce, but that is a more crowded market, where Amazon is king.

  
**3.0 Its business model**

eBay’s revenue comes in many forms:

* Final value fees
* Listing fees
* Feature fees
* Store subscription fees
* Sale of advertisements
* Revenue sharing arrangements
* Shipping fees, etc.

Ultimately, they can be grouped into 2 buckets: Transaction revenue (\~85%) and advertising (\~15%).



**3.1 The key metrics that do not add up**

In companies of this kind, two important metrics are:

* The **Gross Merchandise Value**, also known as “GMV”, represents the value of all products sold through the website.
* The **take-rate** represents their share of the GMV.

Let’s have a look at both of them.

The GMV increased from $73b in 2019 (prior to the pandemic) to $87b during the pandemic and is not back to $74b. However, if you follow their take-rate, it went up from 9% to 14% between 2019 and LTM. But this is slightly misleading. eBay changed the definition of their ""take-rate"" in 2022.

It used to be calculated as **net transaction revenue** divided by **GMV** and it changed to **net revenue** divided by **GMV**.

So, I opted for an alternative take-rate, which is definitely not a generally accepted definition. That is: **operating profit** divided by GMV. The outcome is the % of the GMV that is kept by eBay after covering all the operating expenses. There, the increase is minimal, and this adjusted take rate fluctuates around 3%.



**4.0 Historical Financial Performance**

Although its revenue is flat (\~$10 billion), eBay is a cash-generating machine, bringing **\~$2 billion** in free cash flow per year *(\~1.4 billion if SBC is subtracted)*. 

Behind the scenes, there’s something else worth noting. Not only has the revenue not been growing, but the composition has changed.



|Revenue by geography (in $m)|2021|LTM|Change (in %)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|U.S.|$5.048|$5.185|3%|
|U.K.|$1.913|$1.588|\-17%|
|China|$856|$1.124|31%|
|Germany|$1.249|$967|\-23%|
|Rest of the world|$1.354|$1.402|4%|
|Total|$10.420|$10.266|\-1%|

UK and Germany are contributing significantly less, and this decline is being compensated by growth primarily coming from China. Given that China comes with its additional risks (and competition), it can be argued that the revenue today is of lower quality than the revenue back in 2021.

This could indicate that the penetration rate in the U.S. and Western Europe is at its peak and the average long-term growth that can be expected is around the 3% historical inflation rate.



**5.0 Capital allocation**

A huge focus of the management has been returning cash to the shareholders.

Since 2019, the company returned almost $28 billion ($25b via buybacks and $3b via dividends). A lot of this came from the company’s free cash flow, but part of it came from divestitures:

* Sold 80% of eBay Korea to eMart.
* Reduced ownership in Aurelia (the privatized Adevinta entity).

  
This led to a reduction of the number of shares outstanding by 40%. This is also a very impressive number if it is presented in isolation. However, half of the repurchases were done in 2020 and 2021, when the share price was quite elevated. In hindsight, that might not have been the best decision.

One notable long-term investment of theirs is Adyen, where they own 404k shares due to the warrants based on processing volume criteria. Given Adyen’s share price, these are worth around half a billion dollars.

  
**6.0 Valuation**

This is the time to put all the pieces of the puzzle together.

The key question to answer is - **Given what is known today, how much is the company worth?**

Based on everything mentioned above, my best estimate for revenue growth is in line with inflation, as this is a mature market with a high penetration rate in the developed countries.

Similarly, I do not see any levers that the company can pull to significantly increase its profitability. For that reason, I keep its operating margin at 21%.

Based on my assumptions, the fair value of the company is $20.7b (**$43/share**), significantly below today’s share price of $62.

Here’s how the valuation (per share) changes if you have different assumptions than mine regarding the revenue growth & the operating margin:



|Revenue / Operating margin|19%|21%|23%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|0% ($10.3b)|$29|$31|$33|
|34% ($13.8b)|$40|$43|$47|
|65% ($17.0b)|$47|$50|$54|



If the DCF model is reversed, for eBay to be fairly valued today, it needs to **double in size over the next decade** (average annual revenue growth of 7%) and **increase its operating margin to 23%.** Although this isn’t impossible, there’s no evidence that eBay’s growth will re-accelerate.

I hope you enjoyed this post, feel free to share your thoughts.",Positive,,6347,0
TSMC Predictions,"TSMC has been dropping lately due to export control clauses with the US, so right now it seems to be a possible entering time, here is my analysis:

  
1: In the Board of Directors meeting on November 12, 2024, there is an approved capital expenditure of around US$15.48 billion to support fab construction, technology capacity expansion, 2025 R&D, and sustaining capital expenditures. This means innovation and more profit.

  
2: Approved issuance of unsecured corporate bonds in Taiwan’s domestic market, up to NT$60 billion, for capacity expansion and pollution prevention efforts.

3: Approved the Business Report and Financial Statements for Q3 2024, reporting NT$759.69 billion in revenue and NT$325.26 billion in net income. The diluted earnings per share were NT$12.54.

4: In the Q3 report from TSMC: The projection for Q4 goes as followed:

**Revenue Projection**: US$26.1–$26.9 billion

* **Gross Profit Margin**: Expected between 57.0% and 59.0%
* **Operating Profit Margin**: Expected between 46.5% and 48.5%

Compare this to Q3:

* **Q3 2024 Actual Revenue**: **US$23.50 billion**
* **Q4 2024 Outlook Revenue**: **Between US$26.1 billion and US$26.9 billion**

  
**Q3 2024 Actual Profit Margin**: **57.8%**

* **Q4 2024 Outlook Profit Margin**: **Between 57.0% and 59.0%**

So TSMC expects similar efficiency while improved revenue, so I might buy some TSMC soon after some more dip.

(AHR) I’m back as promised; +44% since first post; senior living healthcare REIT sector outperforming; earnings release once again beat est.,"My first two posts: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/s/4OEM4c1Bq9

https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/s/bKcUEjlglR

All in all with the rise and fall of recession fears and the hovering election reactions - to cover the catalysts as of previous:

Federal rate cuts and lessening borrowing fees, growing average senior age, dwindling rates of new construction resulting in higher occupancy rates, and greater focus on specialized senior healthcare. 

For American Healthcare REIT - Currently the peak was +44% from initial post - with earnings from today beating wall street analyst EPS by 12.5% and beating YoY growth in 3/4 asset incomes. With debt, asset evaluations and growth rate as a rough value estimate, I believe it’s nearing the $30 fair value since it’s IPO earlier this year after they have purchased the final 24% minority stake of Trilogy Healthcare which has generated the majority of revenue from the company. They’ve done a stand up job making focuses on specialized care for senior homes and removing the outpatient medical properties, selling them off as they’ve been underperforming as of recent. I expect more reports of increased occupancy rates nearing 90% which would be pre-Covid levels. 

For the healthcare REIT sector - over the past year with recovery from COVID effects - the healthcare REIT stock sector has outperformed the US market by 22.7%, and the real estate sector in general by 65.8%. With the constantly increased forward guidance every quarter for AHR  and associated senior living REITs and the narrowing rate of new constructions that aren’t set to appear in bulk in the industry at least for a year or so - I expect the atmosphere to be relatively competitive.

The sector i believe will stay strong in the long run but especially right now during times of expensive new constructions costs, while dwindling interest rates (for now) will most likely give way to these companies projecting new asset properties to expand their revenue streams, the landscape is tight while the populace of seniors continues to grow by the day.

Finding good mean reverting stocks,"I came to know that adf test and hurst exponent are useful to find the mean reverting stock. How true this is?
And if these tests are useful, is there any platform which can help me in performing these tests in an easy manner as currently I didn’t find any website to perform these tests and made my own method to perform the adf test which is very hectic.
How I’m performing the adf test:
1.Currently I’m downloading the historical data exporting it in an excel sheet.
2. Reading this file in the python and converting it into and array.
3. Using the adf function on the array and getting the results

This is a really hectic way and takes alot of time and energy. Haven’t made something similar for the hurst exponent yet as I don’t know whether these to tests will give me the mean reverting stocks or not.

I used chat gpt and it told me these to test to find out the stocks.

So I just want to know:
1. Whether these test will help me in finding mean reverting stocks or not.
2. If not, then how can I find them? What ways should I use?
3. If yes, then are these 2 test enough? And is there any platform which can help me perform these tests like just creating an excel sheet and uploading it into a tool and getting the results as this will be really helpful.

Ps. I’m new to trading so please correct me if I’m wrong anywhere and I hadn’t checked stocks using this strategy yet.",Positive,,1385,0

NVDA has become the largest position in retail portfolios in the first half of the year,"Data on the 15 most widely held stocks and ETFs in retail portfolios and sorted by weight, NVDA tops the list with a 9.3% weighting over other popular stocks. Such as Apple, S&P 500 EFT, Tesla, Nasdaq 100 EFF, Meta, and others.

This compares to NVDA's 4.2% weighting in the average retail portfolio a year ago

NVDA's popularity is largely due to its rapidly rising stock price, earnings reports that have repeatedly beaten expectations, and retail investors' preference for tech stocks - over the past year, NVDA's stock price has risen 203%, and in the second quarter, NVDA's revenues of $30 billion were up 15% sequentially and 122% year-on-year, well above the $28 billion estimate",Positive,"Tesla, Apple",686,2

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.
